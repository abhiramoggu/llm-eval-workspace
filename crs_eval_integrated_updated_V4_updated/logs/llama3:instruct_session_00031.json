This thriller stars Jennifer Lawrence and has a twisty plot that'll keep you on your toes. Alternatively, if you're up for something with a bit more historical significance, **Zero Dark Thirty** is a gripping dramatization of the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden. Jessica Chastain's performance as CIA operative Maya is particularly noteworthy.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike a chord!",
