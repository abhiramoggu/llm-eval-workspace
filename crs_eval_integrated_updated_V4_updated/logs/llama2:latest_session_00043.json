The movie features a talented cast and an intriguing plot that explores themes of redemption and forgiveness.\nAlternatively, \"The Whistler\" (2016) is another great option.

With a talented cast and an inspiring plot, \"The Whistler\" is a must-see for fans of reference movies.",

The movie follows Ray Trueblood, who returns to his neighborhood after being framed by an enemy, only to find that things have changed and his brother is now a member of the rival gang. With elements of crime and mystery, this movie should appeal to fans of Will Gluck's work.\n\nAlternatively, \"The Shadows\" (2015) stars Alexandra Maria Lara and Thomas Kretschmann, and has a similar tone and atmosphere to Will Gluck's style. The movie follows novelist Stephen Grimes who hits a young man on the road and brings him to the hospital, only to find himself caught in a dangerous plot with his new friend and his friends.

With its blend of comedy, music, and romance, \"Aladdin\" is a heartwarming tale that will leave you spellbound.\n\nAnother recommendation would be \"The Last Unicorn\" (1968) starring Angela Lansbury and Alan Arkin.
