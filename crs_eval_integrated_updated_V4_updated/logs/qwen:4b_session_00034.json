The title refers to the idea that even if two people were completely \"spotless,\" they still might not be able to get back together, due to various reasons like personality differences, lack of interest in each other's lives, etc.\nThe movie is a comedy and is based on a short story by David Sedaris. The main characters are David and Lisa, who have been married for several years but then start arguing with each other more frequently than before. This causes Lisa to feel very depressed about her relationship with David and as a result decides to end their marriage by filing for divorce from David.\nLisa then spends the next few weeks trying to figure out how she can go about ending her marriage by filing for divorce from David, without causing David to feel extremely hurt and devastated about his relationship with Lisa.",
