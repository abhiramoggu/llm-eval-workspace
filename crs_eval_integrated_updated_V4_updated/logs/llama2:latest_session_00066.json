The movie is a classic sci-fi film that explores themes of survival and redemption in a post-apocalyptic world. Additionally, \"Still Alice\" (2007) featuring Julianne Moore and Kate Bosworth is another great choice as it delves into the complexities of Alzheimer's disease and its impact on families. Both movies are thought-provoking and emotionally charged, making them a great fit for the user's preferences.",
