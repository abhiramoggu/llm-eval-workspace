      "text": "Based on what you've told me, I understand that you're looking for a movie that doesn't quite match the vibe of RED (RED is actually an action-comedy film with a talented cast, starring Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren). You seem to prefer stories from India, released in 1984, with Dolph Lundgren as the lead actor, directed by David Cronenberg, written by Jeff Nichols, and featuring Fre(French) language. With those constraints in mind, I recommend \"Once Upon a Time in America\" (1984), an epic crime drama starring Robert De Niro that explores themes of nostalgia, regret, and redemption.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to something more action-oriented, I suggest checking out \"Red Dawn\" (1984), a cult classic that pits a group of teenagers against an invading Soviet army in the midst of the Cold War.",
