Based on your interest in teen movies and Robert Duvall (although he isn't actually involved in any of these films), I'd recommend \"Unaccompanied Minors\" for its quirky take on holiday adventures and memorable performances from a talented young cast. Alternatively, if you're open to something a bit more iconic and influential in the teen movie genre, \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" is a classic coming-of-age tale that still holds up today!",
