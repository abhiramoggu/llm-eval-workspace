Both films also feature sexual themes and interactions between the characters. \n\n\"Flubber\" is a science fiction comedy film directed by Michael Bay. The movie stars Robin Williams as a teacher who discovers a magical substance called flubber, which can bounce forever. \n\n\"Flubber\" received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers praised the movie's humor and creativity, while others criticized the movie's weak plot and lack of character development. \n\nIn contrast, \"In the Woods\" is a supernatural horror film directed by Greg Mottola. The movie stars John MichaelNumeric and Brian O'Connell as two friends who embark on a camping trip in a remote forest in northern California, United States, which is inhabited by an unknown number of supernatural creatures that have not been scientifically studied or described. \n\nAs the friends wander through the forest, they encounter strange and terrifying phenomena that are associated with the presence of these supernatural creatures in the forest. These phenomena include glowing mushrooms, ghostly apparitions of humanoid creatures, and even the occasional glimpse of a large, flying creature that is often referred to as \"The Beast\" or \"The Dragon\". \n\nAs the friends continue to wander through the forest, they eventually come across the remains of an ancient human civilization that once thrived in the region around the present-day location of the forest. The ruins of this ancient civilization include a number of temples and religious structures that were constructed by the people of this ancient civilization as part of their religious practices and rituals.",
