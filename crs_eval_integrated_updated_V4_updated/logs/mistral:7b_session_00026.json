If you're interested in a family-friendly romantic film, 'Charlotte's Web' could also be a delightful choice due to its heartwarming storyline.",

It's an action comedy that also stars Channing Tatum, which might be appealing to you. If you're open to a slight deviation from romance and enjoy some humor, this could be a good fit. However, if you're looking for a strictly romantic movie, I recommend checking out 'Deadpool' for its witty dialogue and strong performances.",
