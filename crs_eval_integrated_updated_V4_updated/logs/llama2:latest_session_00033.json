The movie follows a successful lawman who tries to retire anonymously in Tombstone, Arizona, but his plans are disrupted by the outlaws he was famous for eliminating. It's an action-packed Western with great performances from the cast.\n\nAlternatively, I would suggest \"Winter in Wartime\" (2008) starring Yorick van Wageningen and Martijn Lakemeier. This movie takes place in German-occupied Netherlands during World War II and follows a teenage boy who gets involved in the Dutch resistance after helping a wounded RAF pilot.

The film is a historical drama that explores the development of the U.S. space program, focusing on the Mercury 7 astronauts and their journey to space. The movie features a talented cast, including Ed Harris, Barbara Hershey, and Kevin Pollak, and captures the excitement and danger of the early days of space exploration. Alternatively, \"Easy A\" (2010) is another great option that shares some similar themes of sound and likability. The movie follows a high school girl who lies about losing her virginity, leading to a series of hilarious and unexpected events.
