Based on your preferences, I recommend 'The Social Network' (2010) starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and the twins who claimed he stole their idea. This movie is a fascinating drama that explores the story of how Facebook was created and the legal battles that followed. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted, 'Hot Tub Time Machine' (2010) might be up your alley. It's a funny and enjoyable ride through time with a talented cast including John Cusack and Rob Corddry.\"",

It has an exciting plot with plenty of action and suspense, and the talented cast adds to the entertainment value. Alternatively, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" (2010) is another great option, featuring Jay Baruchel, Kristen Wiig, Robin Atkin Downes, David Tennant, and Gerard Butler.
