They have also mentioned specific directors and plot keywords, such as \"what\" and \"kind.\"\n\nBased on these constraints, I would recommend the 1930 film \"Hell's Angels,\" starring Marian Marsh and Jean Harlow. The movie follows two brothers who join the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, only to find themselves caught up in a love triangle and dangerous missions over Germany. With its mix of action, romance, and historical context, I think this film would be right up Jack Black's alley! 😊\n\nAlternatively, if the user is interested in a more recent release, I would suggest \"The Monuments Men\" (2014), starring George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Bill Murray. This movie tells the true story of a group of art historians and museum curators who were recruited by the US military to rescue priceless works of art from Nazi looters during World War II. It's a fun and inspiring tale of art, history, and heroism that I think Jack Black would enjoy! 🎨",

The story follows two young lovers from different social classes who find themselves on the ill-fated ship during its maiden voyage. It's a classic romance tale with a tragic twist, and the film features an all-star cast and stunning visual effects. Alternatively, if you prefer a more intense and gritty drama, \"The Wrestler\" (2008) starring Mickey Rourke could be a great choice. The movie follows an aging professional wrestler who finds himself in a desperate struggle to revive his career and find meaning in his life. Both films offer thought-provoking stories with compelling characters that are sure to keep you engaged.",
