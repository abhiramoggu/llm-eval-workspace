This film stars Robert Redford and follows an Englishman's journey to reconnect with America by hiking the Appalachian Trail. Alternatively, if you fancy a more dramatic story, 'Wonder Boys' might also appeal, featuring an English Professor dealing with personal and professional turmoil while trying to complete his novel.",
