With the help of a mysterious figure named Four, Tris must navigate this dangerous world and uncover the truth about her identity before it's too late.\nAlternatively, you might enjoy \"When the Wind Blows\" (1998), which is a poignant drama that explores the lives of an elderly British couple living in rural England during the early stages of a nuclear war. The movie offers a heart-wrenching portrayal of how ordinary people cope with extraordinary circumstances, and features an outstanding performance from the lead actors.",

The film's plot follows a loyal wolf-dog named White Fang who is traded to an evil owner who torments him into becoming a hateful fighting dog. This classic tale explores themes of right and wrong, and I believe it aligns well with the user's preferences.\nAlternatively, I suggest \"You\" (2014) starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Meryl Streep. The movie raises questions about society's moral compass when the right to bear arms is abused, making it a thought-provoking watch that may resonate with the user's interests.",
