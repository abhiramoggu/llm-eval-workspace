In order to complete the simulation, Dufresne must choose between two options: Option A \"Memories of My Dead Father\" (portrayed by John Michael McDonagh)), Option B \"Memories of a Young Man\" (portrayed by Jason Cope)). After completing the simulation, Dufresne is left with a few memories of his past life that he can choose to incorporate into his present life. However, as Dufresne becomes increasingly obsessed with revisiting his past memories and altering the course of his present life, he begins to experience increasingly disturbing hallucinations of his deceased father, who appears to be warning him about the dangers of becoming too obsessed with revisiting his past memories and altering the course of his present life.",
