One night while they're trying to get some sleep, they start hearing strange noises coming from outside the cabin. They decide to go check it out and see what's going on outside their cabin. As they're walking outside the cabin, they start seeing strange things happening around them. The group starts getting separated and moving in different directions. One of the group members, Ash Williams, starts having an intense hallucination where he sees a demonic entity that is trying to eat him alive. Ash Williams then has an intense hallucination where he sees his deceased wife, Beth伦, who is wearing a bright red dress with white frills around the neckline and wrists, standing in front of him on a sunny beach in Mexico. Both Ash Williams' and Beth伦's appearances are completely realistic, and Ash Williams and Beth伦 are able to have conversations about their lives, as well as their relationship and future plans. As both Ash Williams' and Beth伦's appearances are completely realistic, they can easily be mistaken for real people or objects. Additionally, the hallucinations that Ash Williams experiences in both of his hallucinations are so intense and vivid that it is actually possible to experience them firsthand.",
