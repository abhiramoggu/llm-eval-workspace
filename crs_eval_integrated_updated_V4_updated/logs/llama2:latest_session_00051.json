The movie is a historical drama that explores the assassination of Adolf Hitler during World War II, which aligns with the user's interest in war movies. Additionally, it features Bruce McCulloch as an actor, who plays a significant role in the film.\nAlternatively, I would suggest \"Bats\" (1999) starring Ned Bellamy, Leon, and Bob Gunton. This movie is a sci-fi horror film that explores a post-apocalyptic world where a family must fight against a radiated bat infected with a deadly plague. The movie features Jason Eisener as the writer and director, which aligns with the user's preference for movies directed by this talented filmmaker.",

The film features a strong cast, including Nicolas Cage and Martin Henderson, and tells an inspiring story of heroism and sacrifice.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is interested in movies with a supernatural twist, \"Constantine\" (N/A) might be to their liking. Starring Keanu Reeves as the titular character, this film follows a cynical and chain-smoking demonologist who helps a policewoman solve a mysterious case involving her sister's death.
