      "text": "Based on your interest in \"12 Angry Men\" and your preferences for a novel-like mood, I see you're looking for a thought-provoking drama with complex characters. You mentioned Kevin Costner, Lee Tamahori, David Zucker, and a tone of anger - not explicitly stated, but intriguing!\n\nI recommend \"The Trouble with Harry\" (1955), a classic whodunit that explores the darker side of human nature, much like \"12 Angry Men\". This film features Alfred Hitchcock in a supporting role, which might appeal to your interest in Lee Tamahori. The plot is engaging and will keep you guessing until the very end.\n\nIf you'd like an alternative, I suggest \"Holes\" (1998). Although it's a more lighthearted adventure, it shares some elements of mystery and drama with \"12 Angry Men\". The film also features a strong narrative drive and memorable characters.",

You seem to appreciate stories with complex characters, thought-provoking plots, and maybe even some historical or period settings.\n\nBased on this, I'd like to recommend \"The Other Boleyn Girl\" (2001). This film explores the intricate relationships between two sisters vying for the attention of King Henry VIII, which might remind you of the tense deliberations in \"12 Angry Men\". The movie also features an all-star cast, including Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAdditionally, if you're open to a more unconventional suggestion, I'd propose \"The Virgin Suicides\" (1993). This Sofia Coppola-directed film is known for its haunting atmosphere, complex characters, and exploration of the human condition – all elements that might appeal to fans of \"12 Angry Men\".",
