      "text": "Given your preference for a Japanese movie, starring Reginald VelJohnson isn't applicable here since he doesn't appear in any of the suggested films. However, I'd like to recommend 'Ponyo', an enchanting animated feature film by Hayao Miyazaki. In this movie, a young goldfish princess longs to become human and develops a relationship with a boy. It's a heartwarming tale that might intrigue you! Another option is 'The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones', although it isn't in Japanese, it features an interesting plot about a girl who discovers she descends from a line of warriors that protect our world from demons.",

In this action-packed thriller, he plays a crucial role in the story set at an airport under siege by rogue military operatives. Alternatively, if you're open to animation and exploring more of a magical realism genre, \"Ponyo\" is another enchanting option that features a young goldfish princess who dreams of becoming human.",
