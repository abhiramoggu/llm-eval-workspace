Here are two movie recommendations that fit within those constraints:\n\n\"The Change-Up\" (2011) is a comedy-drama film directed by Mike Mills, starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as two friends who switch bodies after a fateful night. The movie explores themes of identity, relationships, and the consequences of one's actions.\n\n\"White Night\" (2007) is a mystery-thriller directed by Mike Mills, starring Sharlto Copley, Sam Riley, and Angelina Jolie Pitt. The film follows a detective as he investigates a murder case that goes unsolved for years, only to be reopened when another death occurs. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric movie that explores themes of guilt, responsibility, and the power of relationships.",

One movie that fits these criteria is \"Fight Club\" (1996), which stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt as two men who form an underground fight club that evolves into something much more complex. The film is directed by Lana Wachowski and features a plot that explores themes of rebellion, consumerism, and the search for meaning in a postmodern society.\n\nAnother recommendation is \"The Imitation Game\" (2014), which tells the story of Alan Turing, a British mathematician who tries to crack the German Enigma code during World War II. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch and features a plot that explores themes of intelligence, identity, and the ethical implications of scientific discovery. While it does not explicitly feature Scottish Gaelic actors or language, it does offer a thought-provoking and historically significant portrayal of a complex and fascinating historical figure.",

Sweeney, Danny DeVito, Patti LuPone, Ricky Jay, Robert De Niro, and Delroy Lindo. The plot follows a career jewel thief who finds himself at odds with his longtime partner and a crime boss who sends his nephew to keep watch. Alternatively, I suggest \"The Untouchables\" (1987) starring Sean Connery, Clifton James, Chelcie Ross, Andy Garcia, Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, and Robert De Niro. The movie follows Treasury agent Eliot Ness as he sets out to stop ruthless Chicago gangster Al Capone during Prohibition. Both movies have a gritty and intense atmosphere that should appeal to fans of gothic cinema.",

Set in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, the film follows a young man accused of murder as he navigates a dangerous game of cat and mouse with corrupt authorities.
