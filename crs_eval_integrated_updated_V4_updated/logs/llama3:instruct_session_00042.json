      "text": "So, you're looking for more recommendations like the ones that caught your eye, which means you liked a mix of family-friendly films with some quirky charm and perhaps even a touch of whimsy. \n\nGiven those constraints, I think 'Flubber' (1997) could be right up your alley! This classic Disney comedy stars Robin Williams as an absent-minded professor who discovers a rubber-like substance that gets him into all sorts of hilarious situations. It's got the same light-hearted, playful vibe that you might have enjoyed in Jason Dohring's movies.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more grounded and heartwarming, 'We Bought a Zoo' (2011) could be a great choice. This family drama stars Matt Damon as a father who moves his family to a zoo, where they face all sorts of challenges and learn valuable lessons about perseverance and community. It's got a similar sense of optimism and uplift that you might appreciate in Deepa Mehta's films.",

However, if you're still interested in exploring these options, I'd recommend \"300: Rise of an Empire\" - it's an epic historical action film with stunning visual effects and a star-studded cast, including Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green. Alternatively, \"Zulu\" is another gripping war movie that explores themes of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice during the Battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879.",
