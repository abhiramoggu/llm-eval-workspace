      "text": "You're interested in science-themed movies released in 2012, with Armin Rohde as an actor and David Carson as a director. Based on these criteria, I recommend watching 'The Theory of Everything' (2014), which not only fits the science and year aspects but also features Eddie Redmayne's captivating performance alongside Simon McBurney.",
