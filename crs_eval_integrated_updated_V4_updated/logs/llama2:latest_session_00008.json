This thought-provoking film follows Marion as she tries to come to terms with her grief after losing her daughter in a tragic event. The movie features a powerful performance by the lead actor, and its themes of guilt, regret, and redemption are sure to resonate with viewers.\n\nAnother recommendation is \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900), which is an American classic that has captured the hearts of audiences for generations. This beloved tale follows Dorothy and Toto as they embark on a thrilling adventure through the land of Oz, encountering various colorful characters along the way. With its timeless storytelling and memorable songs, this movie is sure to delight viewers of all ages.",
