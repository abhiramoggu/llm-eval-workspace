Based on your preferences, I recommend \"Whispers\" and \"Spider-Man 2.\" Both of these movies have a similar tone and atmosphere to the ones you mentioned, with a focus on psychological thrills and superhero action. In \"Whispers,\" a woman is stalked by a psychopathic killer, while in \"Spider-Man 2,\" Peter Parker battles a former brilliant scientist turned villain. Both movies feature talented actors and are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!",

Starring Marc Blucas and Alexander Gould as a British couple raising their child gender-open, this movie tackles complex issues with sensitivity and intelligence. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for a lighthearted and humorous film with great performances from a talented cast, then \"Wayne's World\" (1992) is sure to tickle your funny bone.

This action-packed movie follows a young fugitive prince and princess as they race against time to stop a villain who unknowingly threatens to destroy the world with a special dagger that reverses time.
