This period drama tells the story of Rob Roy MacGregor, a Scottish outlaw who seeks revenge against those who wronged him while evading the Redcoats. Another interesting choice could be 'Holes' (1998), a film that delves into complex themes of identity and justice as a man searches for truth after his son's murder.",
