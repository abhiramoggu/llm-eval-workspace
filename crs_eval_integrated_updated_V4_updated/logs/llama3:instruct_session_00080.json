You mentioned Raiders of the Lost Ark as a reference point!\n\nI'd recommend \"Hart's War\" (2002), which features Ron Howard as an executive producer, alongside an all-star cast including Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis. The film takes you behind enemy lines during World War II, exploring themes of camaraderie, justice, and redemption.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more recent take on the war genre, \"The Lucky Ones\" (2008) is another great option. This critically acclaimed drama follows three soldiers as they navigate the challenges of readjusting to civilian life after serving in Iraq.",
