On a routine call-out, they save a man from a burning building. However, when they get to the station, they find that the man they saved had committed suicide in the burning building instead of being rescued by the police officers. The movie also explores the relationship between the two police officers as well as their personal lives.\n2) \"Taxi Driver\" - This movie is about a New York City taxi driver who goes insane after a series of events that lead him to believe that he is being stalked by his own wife. The movie also explores the relationship between the taxi driver and his wife as well as their personal lives.\nOverall, both movies \"End of Watch\" and \"Taxi Driver\" are great examples of how effective storytelling can explore complex themes and relationships in a way that is engaging and thought-provoking.",
