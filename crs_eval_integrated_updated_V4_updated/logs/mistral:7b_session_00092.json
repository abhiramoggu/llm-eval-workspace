This film offers an intriguing story about a non-traditional family structure with notable performances by Mia Wasikowska, Annette Bening, and Mark Ruffalo. Additionally, if you're open to exploring a different genre, 'Psychic Experiment' might also pique your interest due to its intriguing plot, although it doesn't feature any of the actors mentioned in your cues.",

This film, set in a world divided by factions based on virtues, explores themes of identity and rebellion, while starring Shailene Woodley, who played the lead character Tris. It might provide an engaging watch that matches your preferences. Another option could be 'The Taming of the Shrew' which, though not in Galician, offers a timeless story about love, power dynamics, and transformation with actors like Baz Luhrmann's Leonardo DiCaprio and Kenneth Branagh's Petruchio.",
