The movie explores themes of sound and likeability, and features a strong performance by Cumberbatch. Alternatively, \"Side Effects\" (2013) starring Channing Tatum and Vinessa Shaw, is also worth considering as it involves three homeless men with unusual abilities that could be of interest to fans of Allen Covert's work.",
