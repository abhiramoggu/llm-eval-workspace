Unfortunately, none of those specific constraints are matched in the provided list, but I can suggest two movies that might interest you. \n\nIf you're in the mood for something lighthearted, I recommend \"Zookeeper\" (2011), an animated comedy where zoo animals help their zookeeper find love without leaving his job. It's a fun and entertaining movie with a talented cast including Leslie Bibb, Rosario Dawson, and Nicholas Turturro.\n\nFor a more intense war drama, consider \"Lord of War\" (2005). This action-packed film starring Nicolas Cage explores the moral implications of being an arms dealer, with Eamonn Walker and Liya Kebede also joining the cast.",
