You've mentioned a preference for Persian language movies, but since that's not an option here, I'll suggest some films that might fit the bill. Here are my recommendations:\n\nI think \"The Secret\" (1992) would be a great choice, as it has a suspenseful and intriguing plot that explores secrets and lies. The film stars Genevieve O'Reilly, Ash Cook, and James Nesbitt.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more dramatic, \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) might be an excellent option. This classic film, directed by Martin Scorsese, features Robert De Niro in a critically acclaimed performance as a taxi driver who becomes obsessed with saving a young prostitute.",
