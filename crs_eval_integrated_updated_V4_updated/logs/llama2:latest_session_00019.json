This movie follows two detectives as they take on a Russian crime boss with the help of a sarcastic computer hacker, while also uncovering a dangerous secret held by their boss. It has an exciting plot with a mix of action, suspense, and intrigue, making it a thrilling watch.\n\nAlternatively, I suggest \"Restless\" (2006) starring Mia Wasikowska, Hayley Atwell, Jane Adams, Rufus Sewell, and Charlotte Rampling. This movie follows a young woman who doesn't feel anything until she meets a charismatic man and his group of friends, which could be their last summer of freedom.

This experiential docu-narrative explores the differences of dating for young single and committed women today, with interviews visually interpreted by male creatives. The film touches on themes of modern relationships, female empowerment, and generational attributes.\nAlternatively, I suggest \"The Wraith\" (1986) starring Randy Quaid and Clint Howard. In this movie, a mysterious man/spirit descends from the sky and targets a violent road-racing gang in a small Arizona town. The film explores themes of violence, bullying, and the struggle for power among young people.",
