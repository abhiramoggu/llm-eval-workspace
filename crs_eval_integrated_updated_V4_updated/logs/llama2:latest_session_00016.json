This film has a similar atmospheric mood to \"Annie Hall,\" with a gothic twist and mystical elements. The movie follows a family of secrets, lies, and supernatural forces, which aligns with the user's interest in mysterious plots.\n\nAlternatively, I suggest \"Zero Effect\" (1998) directed by Jake Kasdan. This film has a similar blend of comedy and mystery as \"Annie Hall,\" with a detective investigating a complex case of blackmail and missing keys. The movie features an all-star cast, including Ben Stiller and Ryan O'Neal, which may appeal to the user's interest in actors.",

      "text": "Based on the user's preferences, I recommend the movie \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004) starring Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin. This quirky comedy follows a husband-and-wife team of detectives as they help others solve their existential issues, leading to a cryptically calculated ending that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller, \"Taken\" (2008) starring Liam Neeson may be the perfect choice. This movie follows six friends who are kidnapped and framed by a modern-day Jack the Ripper duo, leading to a heart-racing adventure full of twists and turns.",

The film is a politically charged epic that explores the state of the oil industry through personal perspectives, offering a detailed look into the intricate web of global politics. Alternatively, \"50 First Dates\" starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is another great option. This romantic comedy follows a man who falls in love with a woman suffering from short-term memory loss, providing plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments.",
