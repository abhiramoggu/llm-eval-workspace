The Truman Show - This classic dystopian film explores themes of power and control, as well as the search for meaning in life. With a star-studded cast, including Natascha McElhone, Jeanne Moreau, and Bill Farmer, this movie is definitely worth checking out.\n2. Alex in Wonderland - This lesser-known film follows the story of Alex Morrison, a successful filmmaker who has just completed directing his first feature-length movie. In its previews, the movie is considered a critical, artistic, and surefire commercial success, so Alex seemingly has his choice of what his next project will be.",
