Both of these movies delve into the complex issues surrounding capital punishment, exploring themes of morality, justice, and humanity. \"Monster's Ball\" features a powerful performance by Halle Berry as a woman who falls in love with a prison guard (played by Billy Bob Thornton) after he executes her husband, while \"The Life of David Gale\" tells the story of a man (played by Kevin Spacey) who is sentenced to death row for murdering an activist who opposed capital punishment. Both movies are thought-provoking and emotionally charged, making them excellent choices for anyone looking to explore these important social issues through cinema.",

With its darker tone and impressive visuals, it could be an enjoyable watch for fans of Seth MacFarlane's work.\n* The Rosie Project (2013) - In this quirky romantic comedy, a socially awkward professor played by Sam Riley creates a questionnaire to find his perfect match. When he meets an unconventional woman (played by Sharlto Copley) who doesn't fit any of his criteria, he finds himself drawn to her unique personality. With its offbeat humor and relatable characters, this movie could be a great fit for fans of MacFarlane's comedy style.",

It has a similar atmospheric and suspenseful tone as Ted, and the cast includes Seth MacFarlane as a supporting actor.\n\nAlternatively, I suggest \"If I Stay\" starring Chloe Grace Moretz, Mireille Enos, and Jamie Blackley. The movie follows a teenage girl who goes into an out-of-body experience after a car accident and must decide whether to wake up and live a life different than she had imagined.

The movie follows two estranged soul-singing legends who agree to participate in a reunion performance at the Apollo Theater to honor their recently deceased band leader. It's a heartwarming and hilarious comedy with great musical numbers that will make you think about the power of friendship and love.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something else, \"Cadillac Records\" (2008) is also worth checking out. It tells the story of the rise of Chess Records and its recording artists, featuring a talented cast including Adrien Brody, Beyoncé Knowles, and Mos Def. The movie takes you on a journey through the history of blues and rock 'n' roll, with great performances and memorable characters that will leave you thinking about the music industry in a whole new light.",

The film is a heartwarming and entertaining tale of a local Pennsylvania band that scores a one-hit wonder in 1964 and rides the star-making machinery as long as they can, with lots of help from their manager. The movie features catchy music and a talented cast that will keep you engaged and entertained.\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something else with a similar vibe, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (2013) starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson is also worth checking out. The film tells the story of how Walt Disney convinced author P.L. Travers to let him adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen, providing a fascinating glimpse into the world of movie-making and the power of music to bring people together.",
