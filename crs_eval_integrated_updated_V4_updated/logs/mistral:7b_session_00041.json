In this movie, Sandra Bullock plays a detective who infiltrates a beauty pageant to prevent an anonymous bomber from causing harm. The film also stars Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. Enjoy the mix of action, comedy, and suspense!\n\nIf you'd like another recommendation with a war setting, 'Winter in Wartime' might be worth checking out. This film follows a teenage boy involved in the Dutch resistance during German occupation. It offers an engaging story set amidst historical events.",
