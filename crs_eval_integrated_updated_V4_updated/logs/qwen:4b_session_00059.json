Dead Poets Society (1989))\nThis movie tells the story of a group of students attending a prestigious boys' boarding school in New England, United States, during the late 19th century and early 20th century.\nThe movie depicts how these students become influenced by the charismatic and influential English teacher, John Keating (played by Melora Walters), who teaches the subjects of poetry and literature at this boys' boarding school.\n\nJohn Keating becomes a guiding light for these students, who begin to see in John Keating an embodiment of what they are striving towards as aspiring poets and writers.\nUnder John Keating's tutelage, these aspiring poets and writers come to realize that true greatness as a poet or writer lies not in attaining the highest societal status as a wealthy aristocrat, but rather in being able to connect with and inspire others through the sharing of your own unique poetic voice and artistic vision.",
