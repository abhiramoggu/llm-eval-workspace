With its stunning animation and strong characters, it's a beautiful and thought-provoking film.\n\nSecondly, if you're in the mood for something more action-oriented, The Wraith (1986) could be up your alley.

You also mentioned the Xhosa language, which adds a unique cultural element to the mix.\n\nBased on your constraints, I think \"You\" (2014) is a great fit. This thought-provoking drama tackles tough questions about morality and personal responsibility, with Angelina Jolie starring alongside Yejide Alakija. The film's use of Xhosa language adds an extra layer of cultural authenticity to the narrative.",
