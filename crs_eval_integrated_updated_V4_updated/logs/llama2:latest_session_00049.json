Starring Russell Hodgkinson, Janette Armand, and Kevin Hamedani, this movie has a similar feel to \"Zero Effect\" with its quirky characters and humorous plot twists.\n* \"Easy A\" (2010) - This teen comedy-drama features a similar mix of humor and heart as \"Zero Effect,\" with a dash of mystery thrown in for good measure. When a high school student lies about losing her virginity, a rumor spreads across the school, leading to a series of hilarious and awkward situations. Starring Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, and Dan Byrd, this movie has a similar charm and wit as \"Zero Effect.\"",
