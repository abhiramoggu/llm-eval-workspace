Well, I think I can help you out!\n\nI highly recommend \"V for Vendetta\" (1990), a thought-provoking dystopian thriller starring Hugo Weaving as the iconic V. The movie explores themes of revolution, freedom, and sacrifice in a future where Britain has become a totalitarian state. It's not exactly a war film, but it shares some of those same intense emotions and philosophical depth.\n\nIf you're still looking for something more directly related to war, \"Divergent\" (2011) might be an interesting choice. While it's primarily an action-adventure movie, its themes of rebellion and fighting against oppressive forces resonate with the war genre. Plus, Shailene Woodley's Tris is a compelling protagonist!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more suggestions or have any other questions!",

The film stars Liam Neeson in the titular role, and its themes of loyalty, honor, and rebellion might resonate with your interest in deeper storytelling.",
