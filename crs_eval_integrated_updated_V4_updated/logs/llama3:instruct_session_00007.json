Lin Shaye isn't in it, but who knows, maybe she's a secret golf enthusiast!\n\nSecondly, I think you'll find some slapstick charm in \"Serving Sara\" - this 2002 rom-com stars Matthew Perry as a process server trying to serve an elusive target (played by Elizabeth Hurley). The movie has a lighthearted tone and some comedic moments that might remind you of the offbeat humor in \"You\".",
