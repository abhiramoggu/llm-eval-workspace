It's a slow-burning, character-driven film with a lot of humor and heart, and it shares some of the same deadpan humor and quirky charm as \"Clerks.\"\n* \"Moulin Rouge!\" (2001) - This visually stunning and energetic musical romantic comedy is set in 1890s Paris and follows a poor poet who falls for a beautiful courtesan.
