Although it's not exactly in the genre you specified, it's directed by a renowned filmmaker and written by a respected author, much like your preferred director and writer. This period drama offers a unique take on societal norms and expectations, which might be an interesting change from what you initially expected. Alternatively, 'Elizabeth', a historical biographical drama, might also appeal to you due to its rich storytelling and acclaimed cast.",
