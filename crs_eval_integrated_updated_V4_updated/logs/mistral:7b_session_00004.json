This powerful film delves into the impact of the Vietnam War on a group of friends in Pennsylvania. Robert De Niro stars in this gripping tale that explores friendship, sacrifice, and survival during war times. Another interesting option is 'Incendies', which follows twins as they uncover their family history in the Middle East, a thought-provoking journey filled with unexpected twists and turns.",
