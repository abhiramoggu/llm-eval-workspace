      "text": "Given your preference for a zombie genre is not present among these options, I'd like to suggest two movies that stand out from the list based on their starring actress Eve and intriguing plots:\n\n1. Green Card - A romantic comedy featuring Eve in which a marriage of convenience leads to unexpected developments.\n2. Alex in Wonderland - This film features Jeanne Moreau alongside Eve, exploring the complexities of a director's personal and professional life while fantasizing about movie scenarios influenced by his idols.",

This action film stars Eve and features extreme sports mixed with an intriguing plot about saving the world from destruction. Additionally, \"The Wrestler\" directed by Darren Aronofsky might also interest you due to its intense storyline revolving around a retired wrestler fighting for what he believes in. Starring Mickey Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood, it delves into the corrupt side of the industry.",
