This film brings together action, drama, and a touch of sci-fi with Brandon Routh portraying Superman. In the movie, Superman returns after five years in space, finding Earth changed, and must once again prove his worth. Another interesting choice might be \"The Losers\" which features Chris Evans as part of an elite CIA special forces team betrayed by their superiors and fighting back.",
