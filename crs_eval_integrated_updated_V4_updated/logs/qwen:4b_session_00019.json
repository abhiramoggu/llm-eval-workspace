The movie tells the story of Andrew (played by William Baldwin)), a wealthy businessman who falls in love with Lisa (played by Hope Davis)), a struggling artist who lives in Andrew's home. As their relationship develops, they face many challenges, including financial problems, artistic disagreements, and personal issues.\nBased on these two movies' plot descriptions, both 'Holes' and 'Passion' are drama films that deal with complex themes such as justice, forgiveness, love, and artistry. Both of these movies feature well-acted performances by talented actors such as Tom Hanks, William Baldwin, and Hope Davis.
