      "text": "I understand that you're looking for a movie that's not too scary, but still has an intriguing mood. You mentioned no specific genre, but I'll recommend two movies from this list that might fit the bill.\n\nFirstly, I think \"Friends with Kids\" (2010) could be a great choice. It's a romantic comedy-drama that explores the complexities of relationships and family, featuring talented actors like Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm. The tone is light-hearted and engaging, making it an enjoyable watch without being too intense.\n\nAlternatively, you might enjoy \"Alex in Wonderland\" (N/A). This film is more of a thought-provoking drama that delves into the creative process of filmmaking, featuring renowned actors like Jeanne Moreau and Ellen Burstyn. The themes are more cerebral than frightening, making it an excellent choice if you're looking for a movie that will keep you engaged without scaring you.",
