Based on your interest in detective movies with Aimee Teegarden, I think you might enjoy \"Scarecrow\" (2003), which has a mystery element and explores themes of family secrets and the unknown. The film also stars John Mellencamp as the protagonist's father, adding an extra layer of complexity to the story. Give it a try!",
