The film's plot follows a charismatic but dangerous man who becomes obsessed with a young woman and will stop at nothing to control her life.\n\nAlternatively, you may enjoy \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1593) starring Michael Emerson. This classic play is a timeless tale of love, obsession, and power dynamics between two strong-willed characters. While not specifically about artificial intelligence, it does feature complex character interactions that may appeal to your desired mood and actor.",

The film follows a group of teenagers from different social classes who find common ground in their shared experiences of alienation and rebellion.

The movie follows an unlikely friendship between a single mother, a misanthropic author, and a gay artist after the artist is assaulted in a robbery. With its mix of humor and drama, this movie should appeal to the user's taste for something more tragicomedy.\n\nAlternatively, I also recommend \"National Treasure\" starring Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger, and Justin Bartha. This movie follows a historian who races to find the legendary Templar Treasure before a team of mercenaries, with plenty of action and adventure mixed in. The movie's mix of humor and excitement should also resonate with the user's preferences.",

It's directed by Peter Weir and written by Spike Lee.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider \"The Spirit\" (2008) starring Paz Vega, Louis Lombardi, and Eva Mendes.
