With Colin Hanks starring in one of the options and the year being 2010, I think I can recommend two movies that fit your criteria.\n\nFirstly, have you considered \"The Newton Boys\" (1998)? It's a classic bank-heist movie with a great cast, including Colin Hanks' father, Tom Hanks. The plot follows the Newton gang as they plan and execute their robberies without causing too much violence. Secondly, \"W.\" (2008) might also be worth checking out. Although it's a biographical comedy-drama about George W. Bush, it stars Colin Hanks alongside Josh Brolin and has an interesting look at the former President's life and presidency.",

With Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Rainn Wilson as part of its talented cast, Hesher is sure to keep you engaged with its chaotic plot.",
