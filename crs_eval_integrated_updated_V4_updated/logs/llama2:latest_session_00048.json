The film features powerful performances from its cast, particularly from Lawrence, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role.\n\nAlternatively, \"Trainspotting\" (1996) directed by Danny Boyle and starring Ewan McGregor, Kevin McKidd, and Jonny Lee Miller is another great choice. This cult classic follows a group of drug addicts in Edinburgh as they try to clean up their acts, but are constantly pulled back into the dangerous world of drugs.

Set during World War II Germany, the film follows a young girl who finds solace in stealing books and sharing them with others, while a Jewish refugee is being protected in her adoptive parents' basement. The movie features a talented cast, including Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and Sam Lerner himself. Alternatively, \"The Imitation Game\" (2014) also fits the bill, as it tells the story of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who attempts to crack the German Enigma code during World War II. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Allen Leech, and Rory Kinnear, and explores themes of intellectual curiosity and personal struggle.",
