Both movies feature John Huston in a leading role, and they have a similar tone and style to each other. \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is a classic play that explores themes of love, marriage, and gender roles, while \"Dear John\" is a more contemporary romance film with a psychotic stalker plot.

The film is a life-affirming spiritual drama that explores themes of love and loss in a beautiful setting. It's a journey of consequence that will resonate with viewers.\n\nAlternatively, I suggest \"Wings of Desire\" starring Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk. This movie is an ethereal and thought-provoking tale of an angel who longs for the tangible joys of physical existence when he falls in love with a mortal. The film's dreamlike quality and memorable performances make it a standout in John Huston's directorial career.",
