The film is a classic of the genre and features a gritty and intriguing plot that explores themes of obsession, love, and redemption. Alternatively, I suggest \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995) starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a female gunfighter who seeks revenge for her father's death in a frontier town. The film is an exciting and well-crafted western that features impressive action sequences and memorable characters.",
