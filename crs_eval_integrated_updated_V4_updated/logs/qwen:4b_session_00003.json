The film stars William Holden as Jack Spencer, one of the surviving workers, and Richard Burton as Jim Norton, a businessman who invested in the company that went bankrupt.\n\n2. \"Eraserhead\" (1977) - This is a drama film directed by David Fincher about a group of people who are left to fend for themselves when their employer goes bankrupt. The film stars Tom Cruise as David Mearns, one of the surviving workers, and J.
