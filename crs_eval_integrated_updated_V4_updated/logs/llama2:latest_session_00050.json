Based on your preferences, here are two movie recommendations that fit within the erotica genre:\n\n* \"Lolita\" (1955) is a classic drama about a middle-aged college professor who becomes infatuated with a 14-year-old girl. The film features an iconic performance by James Mason and has been praised for its thoughtful exploration of taboo desires.\n* \"The Piano Teacher\" (2008) is a psychological drama about a young man who romantically pursues his masochistic piano teacher. The film features strong performances from Benoît Magimel and Isabelle Huppert, and has been praised for its tense and atmospheric direction.",

Here are some movie recommendations based on the user's preferences:\n\nYou mentioned you're interested in watching something from director James Marsh and actor Timothy Dalton, but you're unsure if you'll enjoy it or be scared by it. Based on your cues, I suggest checking out \"Blade Runner\" (1982) directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford as a blade runner pursuing replicants on Earth. This classic sci-fi film is known for its atmospheric and thought-provoking plot, and Timothy Dalton has a small but memorable role as a psychologist. Alternatively, you could try \"The Change-Up\" (2011) directed by David Dobkin and starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as two friends who switch bodies after a freak storm. This comedy-drama explores themes of identity and relationships, and features some great performances from its talented cast.",

They are looking for a movie with a language other than English, released in 2010, and featuring Rudy Youngblood or Hayao Miyazaki. Based on these constraints, I would recommend \"Clash of the Titans\" (2010) starring Pete Postlethwaite, Nicholas Hoult, and Hans Matheson. The movie follows Perseus as he battles Medusa and the Kraken to save the Princess Andromeda, with impressive visual effects and action sequences. Alternatively, I would suggest \"Inception\" (2010) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page. This mind-bending sci-fi thriller explores the concept of shared dreaming and features a talented cast in a complex and engaging plot.",

With a star-studded cast including Johannes Silberschneider, Carlo Cecchi, and Clotilde Mollet, this film has a unique blend of drama, history, and romance that I think you'll enjoy.\n* \"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\" (2012) - In this action-packed adventure, Sean Anderson teams up with his mom's husband to find his grandfather on a mythical island. With Dwayne Johnson and Josh Hutcherson leading the cast, this movie has plenty of excitement and humor to keep you entertained.",
