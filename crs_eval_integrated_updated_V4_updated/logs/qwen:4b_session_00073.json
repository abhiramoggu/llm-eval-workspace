In its previews, the movie is considered a critical, artistic, and surefire commercial success, so Alex seemingly has his choice of what his next project will be. Alex has a few ideas, like a biopic of Lenny Bruce or a movie about a black uprising in Los Angeles. As he makes the rounds of both the Hollywood community and European movie centers for ideas, he fantasizes about movie scenarios of his everyday situations, influenced by his movie idols, some of whom he actually meets, like Italian director Federico Fellini and French actress Jeanne Moreau",
