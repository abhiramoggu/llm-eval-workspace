First up is \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), a critically acclaimed film directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon. This movie takes place during World War II and follows a group of soldiers as they search for a paratrooper behind enemy lines. It's an intense and emotional ride that explores the human cost of war.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more unconventional, I'd suggest \"Eraserhead\" (1977), directed by David Lynch. This surrealist body horror film follows Henry Spencer, a troubled industrial worker, as he navigates a bleak and unsettling world. While it may not be a traditional war movie, it shares some of the same themes and atmosphere that you might have enjoyed in \"War\".",

This classic comedy-drama explores the absurdities of war through a unique and thought-provoking plot about a man's attempt to avoid flying missions during World War II.\n\nAnother option could be 'Lethal Weapon 3' (1992) where Jan de Bont directed and Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Rene Russo starred. This action-comedy offers a thrilling ride with a mix of humor and suspense as two detectives pursue a former cop turned gun smuggler.\n\nThese recommendations don't exactly match your initial constraints, but I think they might still interest you considering the themes and styles involved.",
