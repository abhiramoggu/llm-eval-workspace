Starring Chris Evans and Liam Neeson, this movie follows a man who tries to help his father's ghost cross over to the afterlife, only to discover a dark family secret that threatens to tear them apart.\n* \"White Night\" (2007) is a psychological thriller that delves into the complexities of human relationships and the lengths people will go to keep their secrets hidden. Starring Vincent Kartheiser and Alexis Bledel, this movie follows an inspector who is tasked with re-investigating a long-forgotten murder case that has haunted him for years, only to discover a hidden connection between the victim's son and the neighborhood woman's daughter that threatens to unravel everything he thought he knew.",
