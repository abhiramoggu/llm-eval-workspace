The film follows the misadventures of a group of golfers at an exclusive club, including a flatulent new member and a destructive dancing gopher. The movie is full of hilarious moments and has become a cult classic.\nAlternatively, if you're open to a more recent slapstick comedy, 'George of the Jungle' (1997) is a funny and lighthearted film about a man raised in the jungle by apes who falls in love with a wealthy American heiress. The movie stars Brendan Fraser and Richard Roundtree, and features plenty of silly moments and memorable characters.",

Both movies have a high-energy plot with exciting action scenes, and they star Peter Billingsley in a significant role. \"Bad Boys II\" is an action-packed comedy with a twisty plot involving drug trafficking, while \"Rushmore\" is a quirky coming-of-age tale with a unique blend of humor and drama.",

Based on the user's preferences, here are two movie recommendations that match their constraints:\n\nThe user has expressed interest in watching a movie directed by Stanley Kubrick, so I recommend \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004) starring Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin. This film is a quirky comedy-drama that explores existential themes, much like the user's desired vibe. Additionally, it features a talented cast led by Kubrick himself.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is interested in watching a movie with a similar tone to \"Bad Boys II,\" I suggest \"Hitch\" (2005) starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes. This film is a lighthearted romantic comedy that shares some of the same comedic elements as the user's desired vibe.",
