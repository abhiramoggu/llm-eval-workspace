This film tells the story of the U.S. space program's development and selection of the Mercury 7 astronauts, which includes a compelling narrative about overcoming challenges and pushing boundaries. It stars Sam Shepard and Ed Harris, who deliver powerful performances. Another film that might interest you is 'Zero Dark Thirty', which chronicles the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks and his eventual death in 2011. This gripping drama features an impressive ensemble cast including Jessica Chastain, Joel Edgerton, and Mark Duplass.",

This film, starring Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, revolves around a CIA analyst who unintentionally interferes with an IRA assassination, leading to deadly consequences for him and his family. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more recent war-themed movie, 'We Were Soldiers' (2002) might also appeal to you, showcasing Mel Gibson as a commander leading troops against the Viet Cong during the first major battle of the American phase of the Vietnam War.",
