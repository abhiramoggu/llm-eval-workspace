      "text": "It seems you're interested in films released in 2010, focusing on first contact, and potentially featuring Britt Ekland or specific directors/writers like Jeta Amata, Michel Gondry, or a German language film. While 'Dinner for Schmucks', 'Black Swan', 'American Dreamz', and 'It's a Wonderful Life' were all released in 2010, only 'Black Swan' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' can be considered first contact films since they are sci-fi or fantastical in nature. 'Black Swan', starring Natalie Portman, might intrigue you with its plot revolving around a ballet dancer losing her sanity as she prepares for a performance. However, if you're looking for something more closely related to your initial search, I regret that none of these movies meet all of your criteria.",

While it doesn't quite match your genre or plot keywords, its high-octane action and star-studded cast might still appeal to you.\n\nAlternatively, 'Chain Reaction' delves into the challenges small businesses face during a pandemic, which aligns with your year preference and the \"what\" keyword in your request.
