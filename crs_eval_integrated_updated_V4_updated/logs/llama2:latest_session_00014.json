The play follows the story of Antonio, a merchant who borrows money from Shylock with disastrous consequences. The film explores themes of prejudice, revenge, and forgiveness, all set against the backdrop of a tumultuous time in history. Alternatively, \"1900\" (2014) is another great choice, as it tells the epic tale of a class struggle in twentieth-century Italy through the eyes of two childhood friends on opposing sides. Both films are intense and thought-provoking, and I'm sure you'll find them engaging and satisfying.",
