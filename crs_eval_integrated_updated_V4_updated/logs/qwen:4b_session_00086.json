In its previews, the movie is considered a critical, artistic, and surefire commercial success, so Alex seemingly has his choice of what his next project will be. Alex has a few ideas, like a biopic of Lenny Bruce or a movie about a black uprising in Los Angeles.\n- \"The Cabin in the Woods\" (2012): A group of five college friends head out to a remote cabin for a getaway, but things don' t go as planned when they start getting killed. They soon discover that there is more to the cabin than it seems.\nBased on these movie recommendations, here are some potential next steps for you:\n- \"Constantine\": This movie stars Patrick Wilson and has a strong ensemble of New York City acting talent. If you enjoyed this recommendation, you may also enjoy watching other movies from this list, such as \"The Cabin in the Woods\" (2012), which is another movie about a group of friends who go on a road trip with their cars.\nI hope these recommendations and next steps are helpful to you, and that you find some great new movies to watch!",
