It's a slow-burning thriller set in a Wyoming winter, with plenty of tension and violence to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n* The Recruit (N/A) - If you're looking for something similar to 2012 but with a more action-packed plot, this film starring Colin Farrell and Al Pacino might be up your alley.

Starring Ann Dowd, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, and Rick Aviles.\n* \"Random Hearts\" (1999) - A police officer and a U.S. representative lose their spouses in a plane crash and discover that they were having an affair with each other.
