After returning from Rekall, Douglas Quaid begins to suspect that he is actually a spy who has been assigned to infiltrate Rekall  - but things are not as expected. As Douglas Quaid continues to investigate his own true identity, he realizes that the only way to truly free himself from this never-ending cycle of confusion and deception is to completely destroy Rekall  - and all its associated artificial intelligence and robot technology.\nIn conclusion, based on the user's constraints, I would recommend 'The Evil Dead' and 'Total Recall'.
