The movie explores themes of love, loss, and survival amidst war, which might resonate with you if you enjoyed the emotional depth of The Last Samurai.\n\nIf you're looking for something more recent, \"Battleship\" (2012) could be an interesting option - it's a high-octane action film with impressive naval battles and a dash of sci-fi elements.
