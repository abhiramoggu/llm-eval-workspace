Based on the user's preferences, here are two movie recommendations that fit their criteria:\n\nThe user has expressed interest in movies related to war and political intrigue, with a preference for films featuring Ethan Embry and John Lee Hancock. One movie that fits this bill is \"Valkyrie\" (2008), which tells the true story of a group of German officers who plot against Adolf Hitler during World War II. Starring Tom Cruise as the leader of the group, this film provides a gripping and thought-provoking portrayal of political courage and sacrifice.\n\nAlternatively, for a different take on war and politics, \"Hotel Rwanda\" (2004) is a powerful drama based on the true story of a hotel manager who houses thousands of refugees during the Rwandan genocide. With a talented cast including Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo, this film is both emotionally charged and politically thought-provoking.",
