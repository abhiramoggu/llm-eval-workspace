The film captures the tension between politics and personal values, as well as the complexity of the relationship between two people with different backgrounds.\n  * \"A Mighty Wind\" (2003) directed by Tim Burton. This animated film follows the story of two slacker friends who try to promote their public-access cable show. The film captures the sense of disappointment and frustration that many people experience when they try to do something important or meaningful, but are unable to achieve it because of various factors such as lack of resources, lack of skills, lack of motivation, etc.",
