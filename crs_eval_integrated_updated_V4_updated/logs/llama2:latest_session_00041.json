Based on the user's preferences, here are two movie recommendations that match their constraints:\n\nThe user seems to enjoy language-based movies and action-packed films with talented actors like Jason Statham. Therefore, I recommend \"The Expendables\" (2010) starring David Zayas, Dolph Lundren, Charisma Carpenter, Gary Daniels, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mickey Rourke, Sylvester Stallone, and Jason Statham. This movie brings together a talented cast of actors for an action-packed adventure.\n\nAlternatively, \"Total Recall\" (1990) starring Marshall Bell, Ronny Cox, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Robert Costanzo is another great option. This movie features a thrilling plot with plenty of action and suspense, making it a great fit for fans of language-based movies and Jason Statham's acting.",

The film is a fun and lighthearted documentary that explores the lives of Yogi Bear and his friends in Jellystone Park.\n\nAlternatively, \"The Right Stuff\" (1983) starring Ed Harris, Kevin Pollak, and Barbara Hershey is also a great choice. This film tells the story of the U.S. space program's development from the breaking of the sound barrier to the selection of the Mercury 7 astronauts, with a unique blend of humor and drama.",
