      "text": "Based on your constraints, you're looking for a movie that tells a story with a certain kind of vibe, set in 2010, starring Akon and directed by Milos Forman or Tom Shadyac.\n\nGiven your interest, I think \"The Proposal\" (2009) might be up your alley. It's a romantic comedy that follows the story of two people who pretend to be in love, but end up falling for each other. The movie stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, and has a lighthearted tone that might match the vibe you're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring other genres, \"The Fifth Estate\" (2013) is a dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose deceptions and corruptions of power.",
