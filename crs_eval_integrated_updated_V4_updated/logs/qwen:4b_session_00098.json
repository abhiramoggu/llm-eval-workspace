However, when they arrive at their new home, they discover that their neighbors live in a sorority house! As they try to navigate their way through this strange new world, Mac and Kelly are forced to confront some of the deepest and darkest secrets that they themselves have been harboring for years.\n2. \"Eye for an Eye\" - This movie is based on the true story of Micky Ward, a fledgling boxer who tries to escape the shadow of his more famous but troubled older boxing brother and get his own shot at greatness.\nMicky Ward was born in 1940 into a wealthy Irish family. He grew up in luxury and privilege, which he believed entitled him to success and prosperity in life.\nHowever, Micky Ward's truest path in life would be to leave behind the comfort and security that he had been growing up with for years now, and take his own shot at greatness by setting out on his own journey of self-discovery and personal growth, all while trying to find a place in this new world of his own making where he can truly belong.\nIn 1985, Micky Ward made his professional boxing debut against a much lesser-known opponent named Tony Valentine. Despite being vastly undermatched in terms of skill, experience, and overall credentials, Tony Valentine was able to emerge victorious from their respective rounds of the bout against each other.\nDespite this initial setback in the early stages of their fight against each other, Micky Ward was able to bounce back from this setback and mount a strong comeback in their later stages of their bout against each other.",
