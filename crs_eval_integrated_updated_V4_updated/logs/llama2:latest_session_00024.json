This movie is set in a ravaged, post-apocalyptic America where a drifter fights his way to protect a sacred book that holds the secrets to humanity's salvation. The movie has an intense plot with great acting, making it a thrilling watch.\nAlternatively, \"The Returned\" (2013) is another great option. Set in a post-zombie world, the movie follows the story of people who have come back to life after being dead for years. The drug that keeps them from remembering their past is running out, and the characters must navigate this new reality. With a talented cast, including Céline Sallette, Pierre Perrier, and Clotilde Hesme, \"The Returned\" is a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",

Based on these cues, I recommend the movie \"We Were Soldiers\" starring Marc Blucas and directed by Nick Cassavetes. The film tells the story of the first major battle of the American phase of the Vietnam War, and the soldiers on both sides that fought it, while their wives wait nervously and anxiously at home for the good news or the bad news. If you're interested in a more recent release, I also recommend \"Veronica Mars\" starring Marc Blucas, Francis Capra, and Enrico Colantoni. The film follows Veronica Mars, a young private eye who gets pulled back to her hometown for her high school reunion to help her old flame Logan Echolls, who's embroiled in a murder mystery. Both of these movies offer a gripping and intense viewing experience with strong performances from the cast.",
