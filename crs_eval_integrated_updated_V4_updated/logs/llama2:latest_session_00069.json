The film features a powerful performance by James Franco as Ralston, and was directed by Danny Boyle.\n\nAnother recommendation is \"Escape from New York\" (1981), which stars Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken, a convicted bank robber who is sent into a dystopian future Manhattan to rescue the U.S. president after he crash-lands in the island.
