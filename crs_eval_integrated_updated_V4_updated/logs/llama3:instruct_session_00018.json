The movie's focus on historical events and strong performances might appeal to your interest in history.\n\nSecondly, \"Lincoln\" (1995) is a biographical drama that sheds light on Abraham Lincoln's efforts to pass the 13th Amendment, with a great performance by Hal Holbrook. While it may not feature George Lucas as an actor or director, its historical significance and thought-provoking themes align with your preferences.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations!",

Since James Brown wasn't actually involved in any of the movies on this list, I'll recommend two films that might pique your interest: \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" features Kenny Baker, who played R2-D2, and Harrison Ford as the iconic hero Luke Skywalker. The other recommendation is \"The River Why\", which has a strong focus on nature and self-discovery, which might resonate with your desire to find more movies with James Brown (even if he's not in it!).",
