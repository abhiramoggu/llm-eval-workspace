This psychological thriller follows a superintendent who rescues a character from a bedtime story and works with his tenants to protect her from creatures determined to keep her in our world. Starring Jared Harris, Bill Irwin, and Sarita Choudhury, it's a thought-provoking and suspenseful film.\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\"Another movie that comes to mind based on your preference is 'The Messenger.' This powerful drama follows an American soldier who becomes involved with a widow of a fallen officer and struggles with an ethical dilemma. Starring Brendan Sexton III, Samantha Morton, and Woody Harrelson, it's a moving and thought-provoking film that explores the complexities of human relationships.\"",

With a talented cast and a thought-provoking plot, \"JFK\" is sure to satisfy your interest in aviation and political intrigue. Alternatively, if you're looking for a movie that's more action-packed, I suggest \"Fight Club\" (1996) starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. This film follows the story of two men who form an underground fight club and becomes embroiled in a larger conspiracy. With its gripping plot and memorable performances, \"Fight Club\" is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.",
