The story follows Xavier and Lensherr as they bring a young man with teleportation abilities to their organization. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles that threaten their mission and goals.\n\n- 'Planet Terror': This movie is set in an alternate reality where a bio-weapon is released, turning thousands into zombie- like creatures. The story follows a rag- tag group of survivors as they journey through the post-apocalyptic world in search of safety, survival, and hope. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles that threaten their mission and goals.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful to the user.",
