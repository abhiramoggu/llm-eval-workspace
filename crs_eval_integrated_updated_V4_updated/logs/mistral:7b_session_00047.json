      "text": "Given that you're interested in a war genre movie, and while I couldn't find matches for your preference cues regarding actor, director, writer, language, and specific plot keywords, I'd still like to recommend two movies from the list based on their plot and actors:\n\n1. 'Hotel Rwanda': This film tells an inspiring story about a hotel manager who shelters over a thousand refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda, Africa. Starring Don Cheadle and Nick Nolte.\n2. 'Casablanca': A classic movie set in 1940s French Morocco, where a cynical expatriate American cafe owner must decide whether to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the Nazis. Featuring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.",
