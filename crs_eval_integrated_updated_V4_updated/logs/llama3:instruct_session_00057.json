Given your constraints, I'd recommend \"Patton\" (1970) - an iconic war biopic starring George C. Scott as the titular general, exploring his leadership during World War II. Alternatively, if you're open to something more action-packed, \"Velocity\" (2005) might be up your alley, featuring high-stakes motorcycle racing and a thrilling plot.",

With its poignant storytelling and stunning visuals, you'll be immersed in the world of Liesel and her friends as they navigate the difficulties of war-torn Berlin.",
