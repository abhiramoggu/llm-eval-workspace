Based on your cues, I think \"Jason Bourne\" (2016) might be up your alley. It's an action-packed spy thriller with Matt Damon reprising his role as the titular character, exploring themes of identity and deception.",

Unfortunately, none of the movies from this list match those constraints.\n\nHowever, I can recommend two movies that might interest you. If you're open to something with a different tone and genre, you might enjoy \"Why Did I Get Married?\" (2007), which explores themes of relationships and marriage. Alternatively, if you're looking for something more intense and thought-provoking, \"You\" (2014) tackles heavy topics like gun control and morality.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
