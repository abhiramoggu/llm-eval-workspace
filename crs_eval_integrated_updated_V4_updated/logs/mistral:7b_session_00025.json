This gritty drama follows Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a former professional wrestler struggling to make ends meet, and his attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter. The film features a powerful performance by Mickey Rourke as Randy. Another possibility is \"Wolfhound\" (N/A), a Russian action-adventure about a lone survivor seeking revenge for the annihilation of his tribe, which could also fit your criteria for a more intense and emotional film experience.",
