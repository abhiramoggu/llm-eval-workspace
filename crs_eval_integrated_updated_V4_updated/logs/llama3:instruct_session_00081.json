With Leonardo DiCaprio starring as Jay Gatsby, you'll be drawn into the world of 1920s excess and longing.\n\nIf that doesn't pique your interest, consider Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005). This biographical drama tells the story of a young rapper's rise to fame amidst the harsh realities of life in the inner city. With 50 Cent delivering a powerful performance, you'll be invested in his journey from crime to creativity.\n\nLet me know if either of these resonate with you!",

      "text": "So you're looking for more recommendations like the ones that caught your eye earlier, which means we're in the realm of computer animation with a dash of adventure and excitement! Based on that, I'd highly recommend \"The Croods\" (2013) - it's an action-packed animated romp that follows a lovable but misfit caveman family as they navigate a fantastical world, complete with stunning visuals and witty humor. If you're in the mood for something more recent, \"Battleship\" (2012) is also worth considering, with its sci-fi thrills and visually impressive naval battles!",
