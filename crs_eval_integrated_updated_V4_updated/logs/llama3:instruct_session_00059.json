Unfortunately, none of the movies on this list exactly match those criteria, but I'd like to recommend two options that might still pique your interest.\n\nFirstly, \"John Carter\" (2012) is an adventurous sci-fi film that explores a post-apocalyptic world, starring Taylor Kitsch as the titular character and Austin Nichols in a supporting role. While not directly related to military branches, it has a similar sense of action and exploration.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring another genre, \"This Means War\" (2012) is an action-comedy that involves CIA operatives going head-to-head with each other, starring Chris Pine and Tom Hardy as the leads.",
