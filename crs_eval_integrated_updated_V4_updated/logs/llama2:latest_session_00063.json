The movie is a slow-burning mystery that follows a half-Inuit woman as she investigates the death of a 6-year-old Inuit boy who fell from a snowy roof in Copenhagen. It's a haunting and atmospheric film that explores themes of grief, loss, and the power of nature.",

They are interested in steampunk movies with Serena Williams and want a movie with a plot that involves piecing together why they're being chased.\n\nRecommendation: Based on the user's preferences, I would recommend \"Paycheck\" (2003) starring Ben Affleck and Colm Feore. The movie follows an engineer who finds himself on the run after a seemingly simple task goes wrong, and he must piece together why he's being chased. It has a thrilling plot with plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer engaged. Alternatively, \"The Nanny\" (2003) starring Serena Williams could also be a good fit. The movie is about a wealthy couple who hire a young girl from Finland to take care of their newborn, but things take a dark turn when they start trying to kill each other. It's a unique and intriguing plot that combines elements of mystery and drama.",
