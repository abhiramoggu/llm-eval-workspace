This film stars Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, and Leslie Mann, and revolves around the friendship between a seasoned comedian and a rising talent. It offers a unique blend of humor and emotional depth. Another option might be 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2', starring Jennifer Lawrence, which carries a more dramatic tone but still has elements of comedy within its action-packed plot.",

This film offers an interesting blend of horror and comedy elements that might appeal to you.\n\nAnother recommendation could be 'The Dead Zone', a suspenseful thriller about a man with psychic abilities, starring Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. Although it's not strictly a comedy, its engaging plot and strong performances might pique your interest.",
