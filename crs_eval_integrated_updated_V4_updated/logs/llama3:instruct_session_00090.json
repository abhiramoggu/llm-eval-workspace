Based on your interest in biographies from 2010 with Rawson Marshall Thurber and Jim Cash involved, I'm going to recommend Seven Pounds (2008) as a great alternative. This emotional drama stars Will Smith and explores themes of redemption and human connection, which might provide the satisfying storytelling you're craving.",

It's a coming-of-age story that explores themes of teenage angst, relationships, and self-discovery, all set to a thought-provoking soundtrack. Starring James Franco, this film features a cast of talented young actors who bring depth to their characters.",
