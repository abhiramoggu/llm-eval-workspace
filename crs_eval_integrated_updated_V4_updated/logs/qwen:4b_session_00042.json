Hearing Dr. Dre's words, Charudatta realizes that he has been living his life to the fullest ever since Dr. Dre called him. Realizing that his own life has been turned around for the better by Dr. Dre's phone call to him, Charudatta decides to end his own life and become a happy person once again just like how Dr. Dre's phone call to him changed his own life forever just like how it has been changing the lives of all of the people who have been reading this conversation",
