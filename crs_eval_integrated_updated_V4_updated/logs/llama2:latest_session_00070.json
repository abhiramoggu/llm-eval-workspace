Based on these cues, I recommend the movie \"In Time\" (2011) starring Justin Timberlake and Olivia Wilde. The film is set in a future where people stop aging at 25 but are engineered to live only one more year, making immortal youth a luxury that can be bought. Will Salas, played by Matt Bomer, is accused of murder and on the run with a hostage, adding an action-packed twist to the story.",
