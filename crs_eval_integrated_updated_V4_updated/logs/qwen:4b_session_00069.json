He begins by tracking down the individuals who are believed to be responsible for the wrongs that Walter's family has been subjected to in the past. Once he has identified these individuals, Walter Sparrow sets out to confront and challenge these individuals to make amends for their past actions that have wronged Walter's family in the past.\nAs Walter Sparrow begins his journey towards redemption and making amends for the wrongs that Walter's family has been subjected to in the past, he realizes that redemption is not just about making amends for the wrongs that Walter's family has been subjected to in the past, but also it is also about finding inner peace and contentment with one's life, as well as making a positive impact on the world around one.",
