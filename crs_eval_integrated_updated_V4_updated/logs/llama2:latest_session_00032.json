With a star-studded voice cast led by Chris Wedge and featuring Diedrich Bader, Cedric the Entertainer, Ray Romano, and more, this movie is sure to delight families and Owen Wilson fans alike.\n* \"Bobby\" (2006) - This documentary tells the story of Bobby Moore, a footballing icon who faced highs and lows with bravery and strength. Featuring interviews from Pele, Sir Geoff Hurst, Harry Redknapp, and more than 30 others, this movie provides a glimpse into the life of a man who was shunned by the game despite his many achievements.

The movie is a gripping war drama that follows a grizzled tank commander and his crew as they fight their way across Germany in April 1945. With its intense action sequences and powerful performances, it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, \"The American\" (2010) starring George Clooney is a thought-provoking drama that explores the life of Leonard Bernstein as he navigates the highs and lows of his career as a conductor. Both movies are highly rated and well worth checking out!",
