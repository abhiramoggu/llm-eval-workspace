Based on the user's preferences, here are two movie recommendations that match their criteria:\n\nYou mentioned you're interested in movies with a novel-like storyline, actor Ralph Fiennes, and director/writer Jared Hess. For these reasons, I recommend checking out \"The Rocker\" (2008) starring Howard Hesseman, Josh Gad, and Bradley Cooper. The movie follows a drummer who sees his second chance at stardom when he's asked to perform with his teenage nephew's high school rock band. It's a fun and heartwarming story about chasing your dreams, even in middle age.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more quirky and offbeat, I suggest checking out \"The Swindle\" (1997) starring Richard Basehart, Michel Serrault, and François Cluzet. This movie follows a group of con artists who get in over their heads when they scam an unsuspecting mark. With plenty of mullets and silicone, this movie is sure to delight with its absurd humor and quirky characters.",
