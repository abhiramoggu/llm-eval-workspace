When Bourne begins to uncover the dark secrets of his past, he realizes that his life may never be the same again.\n\n\"The River\" is a heart-wrenching drama directed by Lesley Ann Johnson and starring Tisha Mitchell as Ruby, a young African-American woman who moves from Chicago to New York City with her little sister, Ruby ( Mitchell), in tow. When Ruby discovers that she has been living with a lie about her parents' relationship all this time, and that she is not related to the man she has been living with all this time, but rather related to another man whom she knew nothing about at all, and that she was not living with the man named John Doe ( James Woods) who she had known nothing about at all, but rather living in a hotel room with her little sister Ruby Mitchell), it becomes clear that Ruby is in serious danger. With no one else left to turn to for help, Ruby must take matters into her own hands if she wants to survive and thrive in the face of this seemingly insurmountable challenge.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful to you.",
