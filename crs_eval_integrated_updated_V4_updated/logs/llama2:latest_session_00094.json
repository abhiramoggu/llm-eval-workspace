This movie follows the spiritual quest of an adult who decides to follow their childhood dreams and discovers the realities of our somewhat crazy world. The film is an extraordinary adventure that explores themes of freedom and letting go of old life.\n\nAlternatively, \"Downfall\" (2004) starring Bruno Ganz and Alexandra Maria Lara is another great option. This movie thrusts the protagonist back into their past and struggles with drug-influenced decisions that could lead to their downfall. Both movies offer thought-provoking and engaging plots that I'm sure you'll enjoy!",

This film follows a group of friends from a small town in Pennsylvania who are impacted by the Vietnam War. With an all-star cast including Christopher Walken, Robert De Niro, and Meryl Streep, this movie is sure to provide a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience.\n\nAnother recommendation could be \"Tell No One\" (2001), which also features a talented cast including Marie-Josée Croze and François Cluzet. This thriller follows a doctor who becomes embroiled in a mystery involving his wife's murder, and it promises to be a gripping and suspenseful ride.",
