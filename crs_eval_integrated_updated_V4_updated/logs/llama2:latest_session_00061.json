This movie is an action-packed western that follows a group of outlaws as they try to evade the law and find a mysterious woman named Beulah. With its fast-paced plot and talented cast, I think you'll find it an exciting and enjoyable watch.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit different, I would suggest \"Despicable Me\" (2010) starring James Kyson, Danny McBride, Kristen Wiig, and others. This animated movie follows the adventures of Gru, a supervillain turned adoptive parent, as he tries to balance his criminal exploits with his newfound family responsibilities. With its heartwarming moments and hilarious humor, I think you'll find it a delightful watch.",
