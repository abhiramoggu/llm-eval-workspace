The movie has a complex, twisty plot that's hard to put down once you start watching. With its eclectic cast, including Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Toro, and Gabriel Byrne, this film is sure to keep you engaged.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to suggest \"Jack Reacher\" (2012), which stars Tom Cruise as the titular character.
