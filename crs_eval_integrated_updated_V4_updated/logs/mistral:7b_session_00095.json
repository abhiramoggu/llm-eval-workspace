The film tells the story of two sisters contending for the affection of King Henry VIII. Another interesting film featuring William Baldwin is \"Home Fries\", a dark comedy where he plays alongside Drew Barrymore and Catherine O'Hara. In this movie, Sally, played by Barrymore, finds herself in a complicated romantic situation with a homicidal family involved. Enjoy exploring these intriguing stories!",
