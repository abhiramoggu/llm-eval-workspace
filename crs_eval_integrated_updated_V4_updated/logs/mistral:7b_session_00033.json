Another potential pick could be 'This Is the End', a comedy-drama featuring an ensemble cast including James Franco and Seth Rogen, where celebrities are stuck together during an apocalypse.",

Given your preference for black-and-white films and the absence of specific actor or director preferences, I'd recommend 'The Good German' starring George Clooney and Tobey Maguire, set in post-war Berlin with a compelling mystery plot. Another film that might interest you is 'Rockshow', a concert movie featuring Paul McCartney and Wings, offering live music and a legendary performance.",
