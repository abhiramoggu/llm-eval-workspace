One day, Ponyo is invited to ride on a boat with some of her friends from the village. However, when they reach the boat, it is not the one they intended to go on.

In an attempt to calm herself down and regain her composure, Ponyo starts singing a song that she has memorized from some old book or story that she has read about many years ago when she was still very young and innocent. When Ponyo starts singing this song, she becomes even more scared and panicked-stricken.
