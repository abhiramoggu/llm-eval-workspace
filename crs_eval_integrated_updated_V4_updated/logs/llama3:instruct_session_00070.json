      "text": "So, you'd like a movie that's the opposite of what you initially thought you wanted - got it! Considering your interest in a novel film with Tom Welling, Tomas Alfredson, Mary GrandPré, and English as the primary language, I think \"Dazed and Confused\" (1993) could be an interesting choice. This classic coming-of-age comedy-drama follows a group of high school students on their last day of school in 1976, exploring themes of identity, friendship, and self-discovery - all while featuring a talented cast, including Nicky Katt, Jason London, and Matthew McConaughey.",
