      "text": "Given your preferences for a movie set in 2010, featuring an actor named Pink (though I noticed there's no Pink in the provided list), directed by Steve Pink, and written by J. Mackye Gruber, with a plot that has a deeper feel and is in German - unfortunately, none of the listed movies meet all these criteria. However, if we overlook the actor and director, I recommend 'The Fighter' as it involves a deep emotional journey about a boxer trying to make a name for himself, which might resonate with your desire for a more profound movie experience. If you're open to exploring comedic action, 'MacGruber' could also be an entertaining choice, despite not being a prison film or German production.",
