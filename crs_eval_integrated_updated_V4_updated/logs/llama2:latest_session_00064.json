With its intense action sequences and powerful performances, it's sure to leave a lasting impression.\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a thought-provoking drama that explores the impact of war on individuals and families, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946) is a classic film that stars Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Dana Andrews as three World War II veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life.

Starring Christopher Walken, Faye Dunaway, and Jeroen Krabbe, this movie is a must-see for fans of psychological dramas.\n* \"Unseen\" (2013) is a powerful and timely film that delves into the experiences of an undocumented immigrant struggling to make a better life for himself and his family.
