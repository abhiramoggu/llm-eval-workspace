The plot involves a teenage secret agent who plans a bomb attack on a music fair.\n\nIf you're looking for something more intense, consider \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983) starring Ronald Pickup, Edward Fox, and Bernie Casey. It's a thrilling espionage thriller about a vengeful assassin.\n\nFor something lighter and more comedic, check out \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (2004) starring Bai Ling, Bai Ling, and Jude Law. It's a sci-fi comedy about a reporter and a pilot who investigate the origin of giant flying robots.",
