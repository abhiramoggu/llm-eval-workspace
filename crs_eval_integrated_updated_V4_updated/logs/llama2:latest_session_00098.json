Based on these constraints, I highly recommend \"Amélie\" - a quirky and charming film that follows the journey of a young waitress as she spreads joy and finds true love in Paris. The film features an all-star cast, including Audrey Tautou and Spencer Tracy, and its imaginative and heartwarming plot is sure to delight. Alternatively, \"From Paris with Love\" is another great option that combines action, romance, and intrigue, set against the backdrop of the City of Light. Starring Rebecca Dayan and Kasia Smutniak, this movie promises to be an exciting and memorable watch.",

Therefore, I recommend \"This Is the End\" (2013) starring Jason Trost, Martin Starr, Evan Goldberg, James Franco, and Rihanna. This movie offers a unique blend of comedy and drama as six celebrities try to survive the apocalypse in James Franco's house.\n\nAnother recommendation is \"The Number 23\" (2007) starring Bud Cort, Ed Lauter, Danny Huston, Virginia Madsen, and Logan Lerman. This movie follows a man who becomes obsessed with a novel that he believes was written about him, leading to a series of strange events. Both movies offer an intriguing plot and talented actors that should satisfy the user's preferences.",
