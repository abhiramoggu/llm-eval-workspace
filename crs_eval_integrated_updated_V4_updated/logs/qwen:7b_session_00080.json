'The English Patient' (1992) - This classic Minghella film tells the story of a severely burned man and his nurse during World War II. Meryl Streep gives a haunting performance as the patient.\n\n2. 'The Rite' (2011) - While this movie is not by Minghella, it still relates to his direction due to its focus on exorcism. The film follows an American seminary student who embarks on an exorcism course in Italy, showcasing the intense and often supernatural aspects of the exorcism process.",
