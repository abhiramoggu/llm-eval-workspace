You want movies like \"whatever\" that have something to do with ethics, starring David Kross (who isn't in this list, I assume that was a mistake?), directed by Eli Roth (also not present here), and written in Tongan Language (which is not relevant for movie recommendations). Based on your interest in ethics, I'd like to recommend \"The Fighter\" (2010) - it's an inspiring true story about two brothers struggling with their own demons and trying to find their place in the world of boxing. It also explores themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, all set against a gritty backdrop of professional boxing.",
