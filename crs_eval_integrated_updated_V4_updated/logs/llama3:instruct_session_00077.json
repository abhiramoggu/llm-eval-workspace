Based on your interest in war movies and Chris Penn's involvement, I think you might enjoy \"Braveheart\", which tells an epic story of courage and rebellion set during the Scottish Wars of Independence. With its strong performances and historical significance, it's a great choice if you're looking for a more intense but not necessarily frightening film experience.",

Given these constraints, I highly recommend \"Downfall\" (2004), a gripping historical drama starring Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, which might provide an unsettling yet thought-provoking experience. Alternatively, if you'd like to explore more classic war movies with a different tone, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966) could be an excellent choice, featuring Clint Eastwood in a legendary spaghetti western.",
