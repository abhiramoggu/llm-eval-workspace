This coming-of-age adventure tells an unforgettable story about friendship during a summer in 1959. Alternatively, if you enjoy quirky comedies, 'Lost in Translation' starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson might also appeal to you. This film follows the unexpected bond between a faded Hollywood actor and a young woman in Tokyo.",
