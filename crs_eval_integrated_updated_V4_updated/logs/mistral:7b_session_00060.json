However, if we disregard the year and focus on the storyline, 'Retribution' might resonate with you due to its strong themes of justice and vengeance. If you're open to exploring different genres, I'd also recommend 'Zero Effect', a mystery film starring Ben Stiller that promises an engaging investigation.",
