The movie is a heartwarming tale of friendship and creativity, following the story of Sir J.M. Barrie's inspiration for his famous play \"Peter Pan\".\n\nAlternatively, you might enjoy \"In Time\" (2011) starring Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, and Matt Bomer. This movie is set in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, and follows the story of a man accused of murder who goes on the run with a hostage.",
