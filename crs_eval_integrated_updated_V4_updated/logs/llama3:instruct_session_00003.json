It's a tense thriller where the main character is stuck in a high-rise building with no food, water, or electricity - it's a real nail-biter! And while there are no dinosaurs in this one, it does have some great suspense and a unique premise.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more fast-paced, \"Safe House\" could be a good fit. It's an action-packed spy thriller with Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington - both of whom are excellent actors.

The plot revolves around a dinner party celebrating the absurdity of its guests.\n\nSecondly, I'd recommend \"Tarnation\" (2003), which is a documentary that takes a different approach to storytelling, but still explores themes of self-discovery and personal growth.",
