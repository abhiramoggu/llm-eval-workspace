This action-packed film follows a group of thieves who are in for a wild ride when their latest heist goes wrong. With plenty of shootouts, explosions, and romantic entanglements, this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\nAlternatively, I suggest \"12 Angry Men\" starring Lee J.

With a limited budget and a tight deadline, the men must work together to uncover the truth and deliver a verdict.

Starring Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, and Michelle Monaghan alongside Mila Kunis, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for a dark and mysterious adventure with steampunk elements, \"The Golden Compass\" (2007) is an excellent choice.
