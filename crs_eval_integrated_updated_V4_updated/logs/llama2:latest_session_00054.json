This film follows an unlucky-in-love university professor who creates an elaborate questionnaire in an effort to find a wife, but meets an unconventional woman who doesn't match any of his \"requirements\", but might be the perfect woman for him.

The movie is a period drama that explores the lives of wealthy Americans in the 1920s, with a focus on the complexities of human relationships. Alternatively, you might enjoy \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) starring James Stewart and Donna Reed, which tells the story of a man who is shown what life would be like if he had never existed, providing a thought-provoking exploration of the impact one person can have on society.",

This hilarious comedy follows the Byrne family as they navigate the challenges of appointing a successor, with plenty of laughs along the way. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something more dramatic, \"Why Did I Get Married?\" starring Tyler Perry and Janet Jackson is a powerful exploration of the trials of marriage and the impact of an outside temptress on one family. Both movies are sure to provide plenty of entertainment!",
