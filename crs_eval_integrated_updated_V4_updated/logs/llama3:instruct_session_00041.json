Based on your cues, I think \"Redacted\" could be an excellent choice - it's a critically acclaimed film that reconstructs the brutal events surrounding the rape of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl by American soldiers, starring Ohad Knoller and featuring a powerful and unflinching portrayal of war's devastating impact. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more sweeping epic with a strong female lead, \"Cold Mountain\" could be an intriguing option - it's a romantic drama set during the Civil War, starring Renée Zellweger alongside a star-studded ensemble cast.",
