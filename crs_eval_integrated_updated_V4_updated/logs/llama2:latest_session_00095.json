Based on these cues, I recommend the movie \"Maid in Manhattan\" starring Chris Eigeman and Ralph Fiennes. The film follows a frustrated actress who stays with a wealthy family in New York City and becomes embroiled in a web of sexual intrigue. It's a witty and entertaining take on the complexities of human desire and the blurring of moral lines. Alternatively, \"Tell No One\" stars Marina Hands and François Berléand in a gripping mystery about an accidental discovery that uncovers dark secrets from the past. Both movies are thought-provoking and well-crafted with engaging performances.",
