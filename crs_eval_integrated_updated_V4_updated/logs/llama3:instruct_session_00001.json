With strong performances from America Ferrera and Lupe Ontiveros, this movie is a great choice for anyone looking for a feel-good story.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted and action-packed, I think \"21 Jump Street\" (2012) could be just what you need! This hilarious buddy cop comedy stars Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as two mismatched police officers going undercover at their old high school.",

This romantic comedy is a fun and entertaining story about two people who pretend to be in a relationship at a wedding. It's not related to assassination or violence in any way, but it might offer a nice change of pace.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or preferences!",
