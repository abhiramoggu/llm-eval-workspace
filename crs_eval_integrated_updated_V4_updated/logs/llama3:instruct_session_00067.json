It's a humorous take on post-apocalyptic life, with four main characters trying to survive and make sense of their new world. The cast is great, with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill bringing some much-needed comedic relief.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more action-packed, \"The Watch\" (no relation!) might be up your alley. This movie takes place in a fantastical world where dwarves are on a quest to reclaim their treasure from a dragon, and it's got plenty of excitement and adventure to go around.\n\nLet me know if either of these appeal to you!",

With those constraints in mind, I'll recommend two movies that might interest you: 'Flight' and 'Hotel Rwanda'.\n\n'Flight' is a war movie released in 2012, starring Denzel Washington, who plays a Marine flyer struggling to cope with the aftermath of a plane crash. It's an intense drama that explores themes of guilt, redemption, and human connection.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Hotel Rwanda' is a historical drama based on true events, where a hotel manager (played by Don Cheadle) houses over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan genocide. The movie is an emotional and powerful portrayal of humanity in the face of extreme adversity.",
