      "text": "The user's preference for anime suggests a taste for fantastical plot structures. Among the suggestions, 'New York Stories' and 'The Amityville Horror' offer dark and eerie narratives with unusual settings. While 'Shattered' is a suspenseful thriller with a strong performance by Tom Berenger, it might be too intense for some. 'Ted' is a charming but lighthearted romantic comedy with a relatable protagonist.",
