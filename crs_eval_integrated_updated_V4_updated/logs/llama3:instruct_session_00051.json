While it doesn't have Jack Thompson as an actor, the film features stunning performances and a poignant love story set against the backdrop of World War II.\n\nSecondly, 'Kingdom of Heaven' (2005) is an epic historical drama that takes place during the Crusades.

This sci-fi action classic stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who discovers his memories are fake and he's actually a spy. When his trip to Rekall goes wrong, he finds himself on the run from agents who want him dead. It's a thrilling ride with plenty of twists and turns!",

Based on these cues, I recommend \"Man on Wire\" - this Oscar-winning documentary explores the high-wire act between the Twin Towers in 1974, showcasing Philippe Petit's daring feat, which some consider a work of art that pushed boundaries. If you'd like something more traditional, \"Hotel Rwanda\" is an emotional and gripping film about human courage during war, with powerful performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo.",
