Based on that, I'd recommend \"The People I've Slept With\" (2009), a romantic comedy-drama starring Fergie alongside James Shigeta, Randall Park, Archie Kao, Chris Zylka, and Wilson Cruz. The movie follows a promiscuous woman's journey to find the father of her child, which seems like a fun and light-hearted film that matches your unexpected vibe!",
