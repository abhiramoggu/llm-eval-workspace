You're looking for a movie with a similar mood or tone, possibly with themes of self-discovery, artistic expression, and introspection.\n\nBased on your interest in \"Providence\", I'd recommend \"Alex in Wonderland\" (1983), which also explores the creative process, identity, and the intersection of art and life. The film follows Alex Morrison, a young filmmaker, as he navigates his career and personal relationships, much like the protagonist in \"Providence\". With its thought-provoking themes and artistic flair, I think you'll find this movie resonates with your interests.",

The film's themes of moral ambiguity and self-discovery should resonate with your interest in a bildungsroman.\n\nIf you're looking for something more unconventional, I think you might appreciate the surreal and suspenseful \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", which explores the dark side of childhood fears. The movie's blend of horror and coming-of-age elements could be an intriguing match for your preferences.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
