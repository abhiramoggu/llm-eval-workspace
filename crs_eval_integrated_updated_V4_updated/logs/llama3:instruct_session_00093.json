It's a cleverly crafted film with lovable characters, and it's a great showcase for the voice talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal.\n\nAlternatively, you could try \"Cinder\" (2012), which also plays with themes of perception and understanding.

You're hoping to find movies with David Harbour, and while none of these exact matches exist, I'd like to recommend two options that might scratch that itch.\n\nFirstly, if you're in the mood for something with a strong ethical compass, \"Jackie Brown\" (1997) starring Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson is a great choice. It's a crime drama that explores themes of loyalty, morality, and redemption. David Harbour isn't in this one, but I think you'll find it a compelling watch.\n\nAlternatively, if you're up for something completely different, \"Grandma's Boy\" (2006) starring Kevin Nealon and Joel David Moore is a quirky comedy that might surprise you. While not directly related to ethics, the movie does tackle themes of self-discovery and growth, which could be an interesting change of pace.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
