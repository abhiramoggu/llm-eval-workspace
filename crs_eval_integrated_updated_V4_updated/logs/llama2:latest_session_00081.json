It seems that they enjoy war movies with Ryan Gosling, David McNally, and Chris Weitz, as well as movies with Zulu language. From the list provided, I would recommend \"Wolf Girl\" and \"Insidious\". \"Wolf Girl\" is a unique and thought-provoking film about a young woman living in a circus who longs to be normal, starring Lesley Ann Warren and Grace Jones. \"Insidious\" is a suspenseful and emotional thriller about a struggling filmmaker who becomes embroiled in a dangerous ambush, featuring an impressive ensemble cast including Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne.",

They prefer war-related content, Ryan Gosling as an actor, and David McNally or Chris Weitz as a director.

Both movies offer a unique blend of suspenseful storytelling and intriguing plot twists that could appeal to fans of Insidious. \"Psychic Experiment\" features an all-star cast, including Adrienne King and Glenn Morshower, while \"Flyboys\" tells the story of young Americans who volunteer for the French military before World War I.",
