From the list provided, 'Magic Mike' (2012) meets these criteria as it features a male stripper teaching his craft to younger performers, has Seth MacFarlane in the role of writer/director, and while it explores some of the darker aspects of the strip club world, there is also an emphasis on relationships and personal growth.",
