This movie is a fun and entertaining take on the monster genre with great voice acting and humor.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more psychological and thought-provoking, I suggest \"Flatliners\" (1990) starring Julia Roberts and Oliver Platt. The movie follows a group of medical students who conduct an experiment to experience near-death experiences, but things take a dark turn as they realize that the afterlife is not what they expected.
