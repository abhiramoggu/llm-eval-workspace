The film follows their epic clash on the island of Skull, where they ultimately emerge victorious over the invading Persian forces.\n2. \"King Kong\" - This classic horror film stars Peter Cullen as King Kong, a giant ape that has been living on an isolated tropical island called Skull Island for more than 100 years. The film follows the story of New York City actor Jack London who travels to Skull Island in order to film a commercial for a local beverage company. However, when he arrives at Skull Island, he finds that King Kong has taken over the island and is now terrorizing the entire population of the island by randomly attacking anyone it happens to see. Jack London soon realizes that if he doesn't do something about this situation, then everyone on Skull Island will eventually be forced to either accept living as a prisoner under the constant threat of being randomly attacked by King Kong or die trying to escape from the island and risk being caught by King Kong's other victims. In order to prevent this situation from getting even worse, Jack London soon realizes that if he doesn't do something about this situation, then everyone on Skull Island will eventually be forced to either accept living as a prisoner under the constant threat of being randomly attacked by King Kong or die trying to escape from the island and risk being caught by King Kong's other victims.
