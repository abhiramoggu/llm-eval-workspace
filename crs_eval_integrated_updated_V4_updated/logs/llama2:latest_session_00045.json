The film combines humor and self-reflection as a group of celebrities try to survive a series of apocalyptic events in James Franco's house.\n\nAlternatively, \"Before I Fall\" (2010) may also be of interest due to its focus on the main character's personal growth and reflection. The film stars Shailene Woodley as Sam, who relives the same day over and over until she uncovers the mystery behind her death.

Based on the user's preferences, here are two movie recommendations that might fit their interests:\n\nThe Rum Diary (1998) is a unique blend of culture and adventure that might appeal to fans of David Belle. Starring Giovanni Ribisi and Johnny Depp, this film follows an American journalist on a freelance assignment in Puerto Rico during the 1960s. With its mix of island culture and expatriate life, this movie could provide a thrilling and thought-provoking experience for viewers.\n\nAlternatively, Waterworld (1995) is an epic post-apocalyptic adventure that might satisfy the user's desire for action and drama. Starring Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper, this movie takes place in a future where Earth is mostly underwater, and follows a mutated mariner as he fights against starvation and dangerous outlaws to help a woman and child find dry land. With its impressive visual effects and gripping storyline, Waterworld could be a great fit for fans of David Belle's action-packed movies.",
