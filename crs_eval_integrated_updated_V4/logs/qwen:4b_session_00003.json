      "text": "One movie that comes to mind is \"The Martian\" (2015) directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon in his breakthrough role. The movie follows an astronaut named Mark Watney who is stranded on Mars after a mission failure. He must use his ingenuity and resourcefulness to survive on the hostile and unforgiving surface of Mars.\nAnother movie that comes to mind is \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins in his iconic role. The movie follows an inmate named Andy Dufresne who is serving life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with a fellow inmate named Red.\nAs the two men bond over time, they come to realize that their friendship might be more valuable than any amount of money or material possessions.\nAs the two men reflect on their friendship and its potential value, they are reminded of the lessons that have been passed down from generation to generation in order to help people better understand the world around them.",
