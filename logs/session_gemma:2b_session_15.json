This approach would be helpful if the context provides other clues about the movie, such as its plot or setting.\n\n2. **Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques.** You could use NLP to analyze the context and extract the genre based on its sentiment, keywords, and other linguistic features. This approach would be more sophisticated but may be required if the context is complex or ambiguous.\n\n3. **Provide a list of potential genres.** You could present a list of commonly categorized movie genres, allowing the user to choose the one that best fits the movie. This approach would be simple but potentially less helpful if the movie does not fall into a clear genre category.\n\n4. **Return no information.** You could choose not to provide any genre information, indicating that the user should use their own judgment or ask for clarification. This approach would be neutral but may not be satisfactory for all users.\n\n5. **Provide contextually relevant options.** If the context provides any additional information about the movie, you could offer related options that could help the user identify the genre. For example, if the movie is set in a foreign country, you could provide options for the language of the film.",
