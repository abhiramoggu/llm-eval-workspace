      "text": "Given that \"Midsommar\" is indeed a horror film, I'd be happy to recommend a few more horror movies similar in style or theme from your provided list (assuming it includes a variety of horror films):\n\n1. The Witch (2015) - This movie shares Midsommar's atmospheric dread and slow-burning tension. It is set in 1630 New England and follows a family tormented by witchcraft.\n\n2. Hereditary (2018) - A contemporary horror masterpiece, Hereditary explores themes of grief and trauma within a dysfunctional family. The film's intricate plot and unsettling visuals are reminiscent of Midsommar.\n\n3. Rosemary's Baby (1968) - This classic psychological horror film revolves around a pregnant woman who suspects that her neighboring witch coven is after her unborn child. Its eerie atmosphere and themes of maternity might appeal to fans of Midsommar.\n\n4. The Babadook (2014) - A chilling tale about a single mother and her son who must face a terrifying supernatural entity, this film offers unsettling horror with strong character development.\n\n5. A Field in England (2013) - While not as overtly horrifying as the other recommendations, this British historical horror film shares Midsommar's use of pastoral settings and unconventional storytelling techniques to create a sense of unease.",
