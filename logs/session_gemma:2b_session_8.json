For example, if the context says the movie is set in the 1980s, you could set the default genre to \"Thriller.\"\n3. **Offer no genre selection and provide a general recommendation.** You could simply say that the genre is not specified and recommend that the user browse the movie's cast and crew to determine the genre.\n4. **Ask for the genre after the movie is selected.** Instead of presenting the genre selection immediately, wait until the user has chosen a movie. This allows you to ask the user for the genre in a relevant context.\n\nRemember to be clear and informative in your communication, and provide users with options that are relevant to the context.",
