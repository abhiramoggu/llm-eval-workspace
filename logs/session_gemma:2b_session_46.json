This approach allows the user to explore different genres without having to provide a specific preference.\n\n3. **Use a fallback to a default value:** You could set a default genre value that is relevant to the context, such as the genre of the movie's genre or the genre of the movie's release country.\n\n4. **Ask for the user's preference:** You could prompt the user to specify their preferred genre, either directly in the context or through an interactive prompt.\n\n5. **Provide a summary of the movie's genre:** You could briefly describe the movie's genre in the context, allowing the user to understand the movie's content without having to search for additional information.",
