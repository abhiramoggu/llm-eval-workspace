      "text": "Great! Based on your interest in sci-fi movies, I would recommend checking out \"Blade Runner\" (1982) directed by Ridley Scott. It's a classic sci-fi movie that explores themes of humanity and what it means to be alive. The film is known for its atmospheric visuals, memorable characters, and thought-provoking plot.\n\nAnother great option would be \"The Matrix\" (1999) directed by the Wachowskis. This iconic movie revolutionized the sci-fi genre with its innovative special effects and intricate storyline. It follows the story of Neo, a computer hacker who discovers that his whole life is a simulation created by machines.\n\nIf you're looking for something more recent, \"Arrival\" (2016) directed by Denis Villeneuve is a must-see. It's a thoughtful and visually stunning movie that explores the concept of language and time. The film follows a linguist who is recruited by the military to communicate with aliens who have landed on Earth.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or preferences.",
