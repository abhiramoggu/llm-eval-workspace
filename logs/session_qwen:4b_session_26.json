Dom Cobb has been recruited by an industrial tycoon named Saito ( played by Ken Watanabe)). The mission is to plant an idea into Saito's mind. The plan requires Dom Cobb to enter Saito's dreams using the \"Inception\" device.\n\nOverall, \"Inception\" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning sci-fi movie that I would highly recommend to you if you are looking for some exciting sci-fi movies to watch!",
