However, under the influence of a supernatural force, Jack becomes increasingly violent and abusive towards the hotel staff, his family members, and even other guests at the hotel.\n\n\"The Shining\" is a classic horror movie that has captured the imaginations of audiences for generations. It is a film that explores themes of isolation, madness, and the supernatural.",
