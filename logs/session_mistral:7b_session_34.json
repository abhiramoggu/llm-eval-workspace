For horror movies with a strong emphasis on social commentary, I'd suggest \"Us\" by Jordan Peele, the director of \"Get Out.\"\n2. If you enjoyed the mix of horror and comedy in \"Get Out,\" you might also like \"Shaun of the Dead,\" a zombie comedy film by Edgar Wright.\n3. For those seeking a supernatural horror film similar to \"The Conjuring,\" I'd recommend \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\"",
