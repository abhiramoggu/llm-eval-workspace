      "text": "I'm glad you have an interest in horror movies! There are so many great options to choose from. Based on your request, I would recommend \"The Shining\" (1980) directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a classic horror movie that has stood the test of time and is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of all time. The film stars Jack Nicholson as a writer who becomes unhinged while taking care of a haunted hotel during the winter. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric horror movie that builds up to a chilling climax. I hope you enjoy it!",
