The story follows two aspiring musicians, Jackson Maine (played by Ryan Gosling) and Mia Wilkes (played by Emma Stone). They fall in love while pursuing their dreams of becoming famous. However, they face many obstacles and challenges along the way. La La Land is a beautiful and emotional romantic musical film that I believe everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.",
