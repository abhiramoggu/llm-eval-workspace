Would you like to choose one of these?\"\n3. **Use a neutral approach:**\n   - \"We're unable to determine the genre of your movie, but we hope you enjoy a variety of genres regardless of this one.\"\n4. **Offer a suggestion based on context:**\n   - \"Since your movie is about [context], we can infer that it might be in the genre of [genre suggestion].\"\n\nThese recommendations are polite, informative, and avoid directly rejecting the user's request.",
