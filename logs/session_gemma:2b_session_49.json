For example, if the context mentions a movie about crime, you could provide the genre as \"Crime\".\n\n2. **Use contextual clues:**\n   If the context provides additional clues about the movie, you can try to infer the genre. For instance, if the context mentions that the movie is set in a foreign country, you could infer that it is likely to be a foreign language film.\n\n3. **Offer a selection of possible genres:**\n   If the context provides a limited number of genres to choose from, you can offer those as options. This can give the user a sense of control while still allowing them to explore different genres.\n\n4. **Use natural language processing (NLP):**\n   You can use NLP techniques to analyze the context and automatically detect the genre. This method requires a large dataset of movie descriptions or genre annotations.\n\n5. **Provide a search functionality:**\n   If you have a database of movies, you can allow the user to search for movies by genre. This approach requires a database of movies with associated genres.",
