Based on your request for a recent and lighthearted movie with some humor, I would suggest \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" (2018) or \"Always Be My Maybe\" (2019). Both of these movies are romantic comedies that have received great reviews and have a fun, lighthearted tone.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more humorous and less serious, then \"The Secret Life of Pets\" (2016) or \"Zootopia\" (2016) could be good options. Both of these movies are animated comedies that have a lot of humor and wit.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat and quirky, then \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014) or \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (2005) could be good choices. Both of these movies have a unique blend of humor, action, and sci-fi elements that make them stand out from other movies in the genre.\n\nI hope these suggestions help!
