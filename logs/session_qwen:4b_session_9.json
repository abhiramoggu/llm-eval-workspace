The story revolves around a young woman who inherits a cursed videotape. The movie is known for its terrifying atmosphere, shocking plot twists, and unforgettable characters.\n\n2. \"Saw\" (2004) directed by the Japanese horror maestro Toshiki Sato. The story takes place in a dark alley where two strangers are killed by a series of chainsaws. The movie is known for its intense violence, gruesome murder scenes, and unforgettable characters.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations helpful!",
