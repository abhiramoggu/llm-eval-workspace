Consider the tone and style of the text, and the use of specific vocabulary.\n\n\n2. **Ask a question about the passage.** This could be done directly in the chat window or by using a tool that allows you to ask questions about text. For example, you could ask:\n\n- \"What is the genre of this passage?\"\n- \"What are the main themes of this passage?\"\n\n\n3. **Explore the passage's title and context.** The title may give you a hint about the genre, and the context may provide clues about the subject matter. For example, if the passage is about a film, the title may suggest a genre such as drama or comedy. If the passage is about a book, the title may suggest a genre such as fantasy or mystery.\n\n\n4. **Look for external clues.** Consider other sources of information, such as a title, author, or a list of characters, that may provide clues about the genre.",

Like, maybe a story about two people from different backgrounds who fall in love despite the odds against them. \ud83d\udc98"
