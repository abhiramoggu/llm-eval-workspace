Since you mentioned you're interested in both romance and horror movies, here are a few suggestions:\n\nFor a romantic horror movie, you might enjoy \"The Shape of Water\" (2017). It's a beautifully shot film with a haunting score that explores themes of love, loss, and redemption. The story follows a mute janitor who forms a bond with a sea creature being held captive in a government lab.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted but still within the horror genre, \"The Addams Family\" (2019) might be up your alley. It's a fun and campy movie that stays true to the spirit of the original TV show while also offering some fresh takes on the characters. The film follows the Addams family as they face off against a scheming real estate developer who wants to tear down their home and replace it with a strip mall.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful!
