The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Ryutaro Hashimoto.\n\n\"Inception\" tells the story of a skilled thief named Dom Cobb who has been banned from his company for ten years. Cobb's wife Margot commits suicide in order to stay with Cobb forever. \n\nCobb is offered the opportunity to perform an idea that can be remembered but not recalled. Cobb assembles a team of experts, including a former member of his team, who attempt to execute the plan. \n\nThe movie features several mind-bending concepts and plot twists, which have earned it critical acclaim and numerous awards, including six Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director (Christopher Nolan), Best Original Screenplay (Christopher Nolan), Best Film Editing (Ward Heist) and four Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, Best Director (Christopher Nolan) and Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama (Leonardo DiCaprio)).",
