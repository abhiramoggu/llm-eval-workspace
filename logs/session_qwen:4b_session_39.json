Titanic (2009): This iconic movie tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, Jack and Rose, aboard the Titanic on its maiden voyage in 1912.\n\n2. La La Land (2016): This romantic musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone follows the story of Sebastian, a young jazz pianist who dreams of becoming famous, and Mia, an aspiring actress who is struggling to make ends meet financially.\n\nBoth movies are highly rated by audiences and critics alike, so I hope you'll enjoy them!",
