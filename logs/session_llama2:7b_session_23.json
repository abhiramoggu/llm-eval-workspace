It's a classic sci-fi movie that explores themes of humanity and what it means to be alive. The film is set in a dystopian future where advanced androids known as Replicants are hunted by humans, and the main character, Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford), is tasked with tracking down and \"retiring\" a group of rogue Replicants.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!
