Ask for the director or cast's names.** If the context mentions the director or cast, you can ask them about the genre of the movie.\n\n**2. Search online databases.** There are many websites and online resources that compile and categorize movies. You can search for movies with the genre \"Romance\" or browse through lists of movies with similar genres.\n\n**3. Look for reviews and recommendations.** Reviews and recommendations from other users can give you a good idea of the genre of a movie.\n\n**4. Use common sense.** If the context doesn't provide much information, you can use your common sense to guess the genre of the movie. For example, if the movie has a love story or a romantic lead character, it is likely to be a romance.",
