This approach allows the user to select multiple genres if they want.\n\n3. **Use keywords or phrases:** If the context contains keywords or phrases related to the genre, you could use them to filter the results.\n\n4. **Provide a free-text search:** Allow the user to search for movies based on their genre. This method allows them to explore movies with a specific genre, even if the genre is not explicitly mentioned in the context.\n\n5. **Offer a custom search option:** Provide a custom search option where the user can enter the genre they are looking for directly. This allows them to precisely search for movies with a specific genre.",
