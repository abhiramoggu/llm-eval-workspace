It's based on the novel by James Clavell, and stars Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.\n\nIn contrast, Saw is not typically classified as an effective horror movie. While it is a popular franchise with several sequels, they are generally seen as weaker entries in the series.\n\nTherefore, if the user wants to watch a highly effective horror movie, I'd recommend The Ring.",

The Ring (2002) - This movie is about an evil curse that has been passed down through generations of a Japanese family.\n\n2. Saw (2004) - This movie tells the story of two strangers who find themselves in a twisted reality where their every move and decision will determine whether they live or die.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful to you!",
