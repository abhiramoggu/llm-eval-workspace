      "text": "Here are some polite recommendations for the user:\n\n1. **Provide more context**: Ask the user to provide more information about the movie they are interested in, such as the movie title, release year, or any other relevant details. This will allow you to determine the genre of the movie without relying on the context.\n\n\n2. **Suggest a default genre**: If you have a default genre that you commonly use for this type of context, you can suggest that the user use that. This can help ensure that the genre is correct, even if it is not explicitly stated in the context.\n\n\n3. **Offer a list of genres**: If there are a wide variety of genres that the movie could fall into, provide a list of genres that the movie could belong to. This can give the user more options to choose from, even if they are not sure what genre the movie falls into.\n\n\n4. **Use a machine learning model**: You could train a machine learning model to automatically identify the genre of a movie given its context. This would be the most advanced option, but it would also be the most accurate.",
