      "text": "Great! Based on your interest in horror movies, I have some recommendations for you. Here are three options that I think you might enjoy:\n\n1. \"The Shining\" (1980) - This classic horror movie is a must-see for any fan of the genre. It tells the story of a family who becomes trapped in a haunted hotel during the off-season, and it features an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson.\n2. \"Get Out\" (2017) - This critically acclaimed horror movie is a fresh take on the genre, exploring themes of race and identity. It follows a young black man who visits his white girlfriend's family estate, only to discover that things are not as they seem.\n3. \"A Quiet Place\" (2018) - This tense, suspenseful movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where monsters that hunt by sound have wiped out most of humanity. The movie follows a family who must navigate this dangerous world in silence to survive.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations helpful and enjoyable! Let me know if you have any other questions or preferences.",
