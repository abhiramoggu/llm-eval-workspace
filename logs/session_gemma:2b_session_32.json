They combined psychological scares with practical effects that will make you jump out of your seat.\"\n\n- \"If you're looking for something more fresh and unsettling, explore the anthology series 'The Haunting of Hill House' on Netflix. It's a modern take on the classic horror genre that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\"\n\n- \"For something more experimental, check out the silent horror films from the 1920s and 1930s. These movies were groundbreaking at the time and offer a unique and unsettling viewing experience.\"\n\n- \"I highly recommend the psychological thriller 'The Descent' starring Nicole Kidman. It's a slow-burn horror movie that will keep you guessing until the very end.\"",
