I think you might enjoy \"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\" (1979) starring Bill Murray as the young Roosevelt. It's a fascinating biopic that explores his transformation from a privileged politician to a war hero. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something more lighthearted and funny, I recommend \"Dance Flick\" (2009) starring an ensemble cast, including David Alan Grier and Chris Elliott. It's a hilarious comedy that follows a group of misfits as they compete in the mother of all dance battles.",
