The film is both thrilling and thought-provoking, and features some incredible stunts and performances. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, \"Flubber\" is a fun and quirky movie that combines comedy and science fiction. It stars Robin Williams as an absent-minded professor who discovers a rubber-like super-bouncy substance, and it's sure to bring a smile to your face.",
