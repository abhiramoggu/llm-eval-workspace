Here are two that I think you might enjoy:\n\n* \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962) is a thought-provoking and disturbing film about a violent gang leader who undergoes a behavior modification experiment. The movie features an iconic performance by Malcolm McDowell and has become a cultural touchstone for its exploration of violence, morality, and societal norms.\n* \"The Cable Guy\" (1996) is a quirky comedy that stars Jim Carrey as a socially awkward cable installer who becomes the object of obsession for a lonely man. With a talented supporting cast, including Ben Stiller, Andy Dick, and Janeane Garofalo, this movie is sure to provide plenty of laughs and memorable characters.",

If you're in the mood for a crime drama with a psychological twist, I would suggest \"The Watcher\" starring Keanu Reeves. The film follows a serial killer who meticulously plans and executes his murders, but the protagonist, Joel Campbell, is haunted by his past failures to catch the killer. Alternatively, if you're looking for a dark comedy with plenty of laughs, I would recommend \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" starring Will Ferrell. The film follows the misadventures of a NASCAR driver who becomes a media sensation and must navigate his way through the cutthroat world of professional racing.",
