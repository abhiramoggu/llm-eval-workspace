Given those connections, I think you might enjoy \"Hitch\" from this list - it's a fun romantic comedy with Will Smith and Eva Mendes that explores the world of dating coaches. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more action-packed, \"Face/Off\" is an intense thrill ride with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!",
