This could be done in a dropdown or as a comma-separated list.\n3. **Use a more general term** to describe the context. For example, instead of saying \"movies\", you could say \"movies, books, or music\".\n4. **Provide no options and let the user choose** the genre. This can be done using a simple \"Choose a genre\" button or link.\n5. **Use a default value of \"All\"** if the genre is not important and the user wants to select any genre.",
