This could be identified by a specific prefix or by a default value like \"Unknown\".\n\n\n2. **Offer a limited selection of genres:** Instead of providing a vast list of genres, you could offer a smaller selection that would be more likely to include the most recent movies. This could be based on genre popularity or release date.\n\n\n3. **Suggest genre based on other factors:** If you have other factors available, such as the movie's location or release date, you could suggest a genre based on those factors. For example, if the movie was released in a major city, you could suggest a genre based on that.\n\n\n4. **Provide a search function:** You could provide a search function that allows users to search for movies by genre. This would allow users to find movies even if they don't know the genre of the movie.\n\n\n5. **Offer a \"All genres\" option:** You could provide an option for users to select all genres. This would allow them to search for movies regardless of genre.",
