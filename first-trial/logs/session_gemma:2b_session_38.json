For example, if the passage mentions specific movies, the genre could be inferred from those.\n2. **Provide a range of possible genres.** If the genre is not explicitly stated, suggest a few possibilities that could fit the context. For example, if the passage mentions a group of people, you could suggest that it is a drama or a comedy.\n3. **Use general descriptors.** If the passage does not provide any specific information about the genre, you could describe the passage as being \"generic\" or \"unspecific.\"\n4. **Offer a neutral response.** You could simply state that the genre of the passage is not specified and that further context is needed to determine it.\n5. **Provide a suggestion based on a similar passage.** If the passage provides a sample text with a known genre, you could suggest that the passage you are considering has the same genre.\n6. **Ask for clarification.** If you are still unable to determine the genre, you could ask the user for clarification or provide them with additional context.",
