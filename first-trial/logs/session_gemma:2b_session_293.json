For example, you could specify \"All Genres\" or \"Genre Not Specified\".\n\n**2. Use a placeholder value.**\n\nYou can use a placeholder value, such as \"Unknown Genre\", to represent the absence of a genre. This can make it easier to handle the case where the genre is not specified.\n\n**3. Use a different extraction method.**\n\nYou can use a different extraction method, such as using regular expressions or natural language processing, to try to extract the genre from the context. However, this approach may be more complex and may not always be successful.\n\n**4. Provide a context-based hint.**\n\nYou can provide a context-based hint that suggests the genre that is being requested. For example, if the context mentions a genre in the title or description of a movie, you could provide that information as a hint.\n\n**5. Handle the case where the genre is not specified explicitly.**\n\nYou can handle the case where the genre is not specified explicitly by using a default value, a placeholder value, or a different extraction method. However, this approach may not be as efficient or accurate as the other options.",
