Ask for context:**\n\n* \"What genre does this movie fall into?\"\n* \"Could you give me a hint about the genre of the movie?\"\n* \"I'm curious to know what genre this is, could you give me a clue?\"\n\n**2.  Provide a few possible genres:**\n\n* \"What genre do you think this movie might be?\"\n* \"I'm guessing this movie might be a [genre 1] or [genre 2].\"\n* \"I'm not sure what genre this movie falls into, but it seems to be [genre 1] or [genre 2].\"\n\n**3.  Offer a neutral response:**\n\n* \"I'm not able to specify the genre of this movie, as the context is silent.\"\n* \"The genre of this movie is not explicitly stated in the context, so I cannot recommend one.\"\n* \"I am unable to provide a genre for this movie, as the context does not provide any clues.\"\n\n**4.  Emphasize the importance of context:**\n\n* \"The genre of this movie is not mentioned in the context, which is crucial for determining its genre.\"\n* \"Without the context, it is impossible to identify the genre of this movie.\"\n* \"I am unable to recommend a genre for this movie, as the context does not provide any information about its genre.\"\n\nBy considering the context and providing a few options for recommendations, you can help the user find a genre for the movie even if it is not explicitly stated.",
