This gives users more options to explore.\n\n\n3. **Leave the genre field blank.** If users leave the genre field blank, you can assume the context is empty and provide no suggestions.\n\n\n4. **Display a message to encourage users to select a genre.** You can gently remind users that selecting a genre is necessary to filter content, and provide a helpful message to guide them.\n\n\n5. **Use contextually relevant information.** If there is other information in the context, such as the movie title or the search query, you can use this context to infer the genre.",
