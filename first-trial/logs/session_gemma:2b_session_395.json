      "text": "Sure, here are a few polite recommendations on how to handle the user's request:\n\n1. **Provide a default genre:** You can offer a default genre option, such as \"All Genres,\" \"Genre Not Specified,\" or \"Genre Not Provided.\" This gives the user a choice and avoids having to guess the genre.\n\n\n2. **Offer a list of genres:** If you have a list of genres to choose from, you can provide it in the context. This allows the user to filter movies based on genre.\n\n\n3. **Use a placeholder:** You can use a placeholder, such as \"Please select a genre,\" in the context. This helps to guide the user and gives them a sense of control over the search.\n\n\n4. **Provide a search without a genre filter:** If it is possible, you can allow the search to be conducted without a genre filter. This allows the user to search for movies regardless of their genre.\n\n\n5. **Use a hint or suggestion:** Provide a hint or suggestion related to the movie's topic or plot. This can help the user to guess the genre.",
