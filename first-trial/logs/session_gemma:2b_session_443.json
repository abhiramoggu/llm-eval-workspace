This will be the default option if the genre is not explicitly specified.\n\n\n2. **Offer a selection of genres:** \n   Provide a list of genres for the user to choose from. This allows them to select the genre they prefer directly.\n\n\n3. **Use a placeholder value:** \n   Set a placeholder value for the genre field, such as \"Unknown\" or \"N/A\". This is a neutral option that indicates that the genre is unknown or not relevant to the context.\n\n\n4. **Provide a search or filter option based on genre:** \n   Allow the user to search or filter content based on genre. This gives them a way to find movies with a specific genre.\n\n\n5. **Use a default value based on context:** \n   If the context provides other relevant information, such as the movie category or subject matter, use that information to set the default genre. This ensures that the genre is consistent with the context.",
