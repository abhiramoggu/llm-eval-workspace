For example, the movie title itself may give a hint.\n2. **Suggest a default genre:** If there are a limited number of genre options that are applicable to the context, you could suggest a default genre, such as \"All Genres.\"\n3. **Provide a range of genre options:** If the context allows, you could provide a range of genre options to choose from. This gives users more flexibility and control over the genre selection.\n4. **Ask for clarification:** If the context is ambiguous or incomplete, you could ask users to provide more context or to clarify the genre they have in mind.\n5. **Offer a neutral option:** You could offer a neutral option or \"Other\" to allow users to select a genre that they feel best fits the context, even if it is not explicitly stated.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can recommend options that are both polite and helpful to users.",
