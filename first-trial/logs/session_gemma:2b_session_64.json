This would allow the user to specify a genre that is not explicitly stated, but it would also be more sensitive to misspellings.\n\n\n3. **Let the user choose the genre.** You could provide a dropdown menu or a list of genres for the user to choose from. This would give the user more control over the genre they select and would ensure that it is the genre they intended.",
