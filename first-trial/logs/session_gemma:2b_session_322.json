      "text": "Sure. Here are some recommendations on how to handle the scenario where the genre is not specified in the context:\n\n**1. Default to a genre:**\n\n* Set a default genre to a reasonable value, such as \"Unknown\" or \"Genre Not Provided\".\n* This option provides a clear indication to the user that the genre is missing.\n\n**2. Provide a selection of genres:**\n\n* Offer a list of commonly recognized genres to choose from.\n* This approach allows the user to select the genre they prefer manually.\n\n**3. Use a fallback to a default genre:**\n\n* If no genre is explicitly specified, choose a predefined genre based on the context.\n* For example, if the movie is set in the United States, you could default to \"Hollywood\".\n\n**4. Allow free-form entry:**\n\n* Provide an option for users to enter the genre themselves.\n* This approach gives them more control over the selection process.\n\n**5. Use a combination of the above approaches:**\n\n* Combine different techniques to provide a flexible and comprehensive experience.\n* For example, offer both a default genre and a list of genres.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n* Provide a clear and concise explanation to the user about the missing genre field.\n* Offer a helpful message or suggestion, such as \"We couldn't find the genre for this movie.\"\n* Be flexible and allow users to adjust the genre selection process as needed.",
