For example, if the movie is set in the United States, you could suggest a list of American genres.\n\n\n3. **Provide a list of genres to choose from.** This option is more cumbersome than the first two options, but it can be helpful if the user is looking for a specific genre.\n\n\n4. **Use a default genre of \"All.\"** This option can be useful if the user is not interested in specifying a genre or if the context does not provide any information about the genre.",
