For example, you could specify \"genre=action\" or \"genre=comedy\".\n\n2. **Use a wildcard character**: Use a wildcard character to match any number of characters in the genre field. For example, you could specify \"genre=*\" or \"genre=*.genre\".\n\n3. **Provide a list of genres**: If the user wants to specify multiple genres, you could provide a list of genres in the context. For example, you could specify \"genre=[\"action\", \"comedy\", \"science fiction]\".\n\n4. **Use a natural language query**: You could use a natural language query to describe the genre.
