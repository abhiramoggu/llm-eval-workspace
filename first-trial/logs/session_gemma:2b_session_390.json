You could suggest that they search by genre to find movies with that specific genre.\n\n\n2. **Provide a default genre:** You could provide a default genre that is likely to be relevant to the context. For example, if the context mentions a specific movie genre, you could suggest the genre \"Science Fiction\" as the default.\n\n\n3. **Offer a list of potential genres:** If there are a wide variety of genres to choose from, you could provide a list of potential genres for users to browse. This would give them more options to explore.\n\n\n4. **Ask for clarification:** If the context is ambiguous or if there is any other way to determine the genre, you could ask the user to provide some clarification or to tell you what they are looking for.\n\n\n5. **Offer a search by keywords:** If the context mentions a few keywords related to the movie, you could offer a search by keywords option to help users find movies with those specific keywords.",
