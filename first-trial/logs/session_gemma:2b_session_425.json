This approach is clear and straightforward, and it gives the user the opportunity to provide the missing information.\n\n\n2. **Offer alternative ways to specify the genre**. For example, you could ask the user to select from a list of available genres, or you could allow them to enter a free text description of the genre.\n\n\n3. **Provide a default genre option**. You could offer a default genre option, such as \"All\" or \"Genre Not Provided,\" that will be selected if the user does not specify a genre.\n\n\n4. **Use a placeholder or default value**. You could use a placeholder like \"Genre\" or a default value like \"N/A\" to indicate that the genre is not specified. This approach can be useful if the genre is not relevant to the context.",
