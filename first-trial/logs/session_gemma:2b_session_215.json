Provide a default genre option:**\n\n```python\ngenre = \"Movies\" if \"genre\" not in context else context[\"genre\"]\n```\n\n**3. Use a wildcard genre:**\n\n```python\ngenre = \"*\" if \"genre\" not in context else context[\"genre\"]\n```\n\n**4. Specify a catch-all genre:**\n\n```python\ngenre = \"Any\" if \"genre\" not in context else context[\"genre\"]\n```\n\n**5. Handle the case where the context is empty:**\n\n```python\ngenre = \"\" if \"genre\" not in context else context[\"genre\"]\n```\n\n**6. Use a conditional statement:**\n\n```python\nif \"genre\" in context:\n    genre = context[\"genre\"]\nelse:\n    genre = \"Unknown\"\n```\n\nBy using these methods, you can determine the genre of the movie without relying on the context.",
