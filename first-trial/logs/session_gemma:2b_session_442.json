This would indicate that the genre is unknown and should be left unspecified.\n\n**Option 3: Ask the user for the genre.**\n\nYou could ask the user to provide the genre of the movie or show they are interested in. This option would give the user more control over the context.\n\n**Option 4: Use a default value from a database or other source.**\n\nIf you have a database or other source of movie and show information, you could use a default genre value from that source.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\"The context does not provide any information about the genre of the movie or show, so I will use the default genre 'Genre Not Provided'.\"",

This gives them the control to choose the genre they prefer.\n\n\n3. **Use a neutral default:** Instead of providing a specific genre, you can leave the genre field blank or empty. This allows the user to select the genre they prefer without any predefined selection.\n\n\n4. **Provide a list of genres:** You can create a list of genres that the context suggests are relevant to the topic. This approach allows the user to explore different genres without having to search for them individually.\n\n\n5. **Use a conditional statement:** You can use an if-else statement to check if the genre is missing in the context and then provide a default value or prompt the user to specify the genre.",
