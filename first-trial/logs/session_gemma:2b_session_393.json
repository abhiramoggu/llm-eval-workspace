This option will be selected if the genre is not explicitly mentioned in the context.\n\n\n* **Highlight the context's genre:** If the context provides a specific genre, you can highlight it to the user, indicating that the genre is already set. This can help avoid confusion and ensure that the desired genre is selected correctly.\n\n\n* **Offer a list of genres:** If there are multiple genres available, you can provide a list of options, allowing the user to choose the genre they prefer. This approach gives them more control and helps prevent the selection of an invalid genre.\n\n\n* **Use a default value in your search query:** You can modify your search query to use a default value for the genre parameter. This approach allows the search to be performed even if the genre is not specified, while still providing results based on the user's preference.\n\n\n* **Provide a hint or suggestion:** If the context provides a hint or suggestion about the genre, you can offer it to the user to help them choose the desired option. This can be done verbally or through an on-screen message.",
