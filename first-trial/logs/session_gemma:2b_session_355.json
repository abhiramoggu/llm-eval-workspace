This would provide a reasonable starting point for users who don't specify a genre.\n* **Offer a flexible search:** Instead of restricting the search to a single genre, you could offer a broader search that allows users to explore movies across different genres. This would give them more control over their search.\n* **Use a neutral or vague term:** You could use a term like \"Movies\" or \"Films\" in the search query, which would indicate that the genre is not important for the purpose of the search.\n* **Highlight that genre information is missing:** You could explicitly mention that the genre is not specified in the context, but provide guidance on how users can specify it if they want to refine their search.\n* **Offer alternative search options:** Consider including additional search parameters or filters that users can use to refine their results, such as release date, release country, or runtime.",
