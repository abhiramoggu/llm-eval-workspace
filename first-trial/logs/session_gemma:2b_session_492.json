This is a respectful and effective way to gather the necessary information.\n\n\n2. **Provide a few potential genres.** If the context suggests multiple genres, offer a few options to choose from. This gives the user more control and allows you to tailor your response accordingly.\n\n\n3. **Suggest a genre based on the context.** If the context provides any clues about the topic or theme of the quote, suggest a genre that might fit. This can be helpful if the genre is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.\n\n\n4. **Offer a neutral response.** In some cases, it may be appropriate to provide a neutral response that acknowledges that the genre of the quote is not explicitly mentioned. This can be helpful if you want to avoid making any assumptions or leading the user further down the wrong path.\n\n\n5. **Use a default genre.** If the context is ambiguous or lacks any clues, you can provide a default genre, such as \"All of these.\" This is a simple and neutral option that provides a clear answer to the question.\n\n\nRemember to choose the option that best fits the situation and provides a balance between being helpful and respecting the user's desire for more context.",
