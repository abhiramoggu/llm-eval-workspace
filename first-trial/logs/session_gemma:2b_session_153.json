This option would allow the user to specify their preferred genre(s).\n3. **Use a default value based on the context:** You can use a value from the context itself as the default genre. For example, if the context specifies the movie title \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" you could set the default genre to \"Crime.\"\n4. **Provide a suggestion based on the context:** You can use a value from the context to suggest a genre. For example, if the context specifies that the movie is set in the 1990s, you could suggest the genre \"Action\" as a default.\n\nBy providing these options, you can ensure that the genre is chosen by the user, regardless of whether it is specified in the context.",
