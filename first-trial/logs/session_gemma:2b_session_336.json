      "text": "Sure, here are the options you can recommend:\n\n1. **Provide a default genre.** Defaulting to a genre like \"All\" or \"Genre Not Provided\" can be a simple and straightforward option.\n\n\n2. **Offer a limited selection of genres.** If there are a few genres that are most likely to be relevant, you can provide a limited selection of options for the user to choose from.\n\n\n3. **Use a wildcard character.** You can use a wildcard character like \"%\" to allow for multiple possibilities in the genre name.\n\n\n4. **Provide a text description of the genre.** If the genre is not easily identified by its name, you can provide a text description of it. This can give the user more context and help them to select the correct genre.\n\n\n5. **Offer a machine learning model.** You can train a machine learning model to automatically identify the genre of a movie. This method can be more accurate than other options, but it requires more development effort.",
