Recommend based on popular genres:**\n\n* Recommend movies with high popularity across different genres. \n* You could use genre-based rankings or popular genre lists like Rotten Tomatoes. \n* Offer a few popular genres and allow users to explore those.\n\n**2. Recommend by genre-related keywords:**\n\n* If the context mentions a specific movie or actor, suggest the genre based on that. \n* For example, if the context mentions a superhero movie, suggest a genre like \"superhero movie.\"\n\n**3. Recommend based on genre-related actors or directors:**\n\n* If the context mentions any actors or directors, suggest the genre based on their known work. \n* You could also recommend movies they have starred in.\n\n**4. Recommend based on genre-related awards or nominations:**\n\n* Suggest the genre based on awards or nominations the movie has received. \n* This approach focuses on recommending movies based on their historical significance and genre association.\n\n**5. Offer a \"All genres\" option:**\n\n* Allow users to choose \"All genres\" if they are unsure of a specific genre or do not have any preference.\n\n**6. Suggest the genre as \"unknown\":**\n\n* This option is neutral and suggests that the genre is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n* When suggesting a genre, be transparent and clear about how you arrived at the recommendation.\n* Use clear and concise language that is easy for users to understand.\n* Offer a preview of the suggested genre for users to confirm or adjust their preference.\n\nBy considering these recommendations and using a combination of the approaches mentioned, you can provide a helpful and informative recommendation for the user.",
