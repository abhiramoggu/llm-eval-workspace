This is a straightforward option that provides a clear starting point for the user.\n\n2. **Offer a limited selection of genres.** If the context provides a limited number of genres to choose from, consider offering a select of popular or relevant genres. This can help narrow down the options and make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for.\n\n3. **Suggest a genre based on the context.** Analyze the context and suggest a genre that is implied or supported by the information. This approach can be helpful if the context is not specific or if the genre is not the primary focus of the conversation.\n\n4. **Provide a suggestion based on the context.** If the context provides any specific clues or hints about the genre, consider suggesting a genre that aligns with those clues. This approach can help the user narrow down their choices and find the appropriate genre.\n\n5. **Offer a free-form suggestion.** In some cases, providing a free-form suggestion where the user can enter their preferred genre can be the most effective option. This gives the user full control over the search and allows them to discover new genres they may not have been aware of otherwise.",
