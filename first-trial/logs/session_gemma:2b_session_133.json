This option allows the user to choose the genre they prefer.\n\n\n3. **Use natural language processing**: Use a natural language processing (NLP) library or model to analyze the movie's content and determine the genre. This option can be more accurate than simple keyword matching.\n\n\n4. **Ask for the genre in a separate step**: Instead of providing the genre in the context, you can ask the user to select it later. This allows you to ensure that the genre is relevant to the movie they are selecting.\n\n\n5. **Return a neutral response**: If the genre is not specified in the context and cannot be determined from the context, you can provide a neutral response, such as \"Genre not specified\" or \"Genre not relevant to the context.\"",
