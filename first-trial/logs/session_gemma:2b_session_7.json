For example, if the context is about a movie about cars, you could offer \"Automobile\" as the default genre.\n2. **Provide a list of genres to choose from.** You could offer a list of genres that the movie falls into, such as \"Comedy,\" \"Drama,\" \"Sci-Fi,\" etc. This would give the user more flexibility in their choice.\n3. **Use keywords or phrases that are indicative of the movie's genre.** You could use keywords or phrases that are commonly used to describe the movie's genre, such as \"space adventure,\" \"fantasy,\" \"thriller,\" etc.\n4. **Use a machine learning model to classify the movie's genre.** You could train a machine learning model on a dataset of movies with known genres. This model could then be used to automatically classify the genre of a movie based on its content.\n5. **Provide a way for the user to specify the genre themselves.** If the user is unable to provide any of the above information, you could allow them to specify the genre themselves. This could be done through a text field, a drop-down menu, or a checkbox.",
