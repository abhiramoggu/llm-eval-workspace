For example, if the movie is set in a fantasy world, you could specify the genre as \"Fantasy\".\n\n2. **Offer a limited set of choices**: Provide a limited range of genres that are commonly associated with the movie's genre. This could include options such as \"Action\", \"Comedy\", \"Drama\", or \"Sci-Fi\".\n\n3. **Ask for the user's opinion**: Instead of directly asking for the genre, you could ask the user to provide their thoughts on the movie's genre or to select from a list of suggested genres.\n\n4. **Provide alternative context**: If the context provides any other relevant information about the movie, such as its plot or cast, you could use that information to infer the genre.\n\n5. **Use machine learning**: If you have access to a large dataset of movie reviews or metadata, you could use machine learning techniques to analyze the context and automatically identify the movie's genre.",
