This could be a broad genre like \"Movie\" or \"TV Show\", or a more specific genre like \"Sci-Fi\" or \"Comedy\".\n2. **Provide a list of genres to choose from**. This could be displayed in a dropdown menu or as a comma-separated list.\n3. **Use a wildcard character** to allow users to search for a genre that is not explicitly stated. For example, if the user types \"movie\", they could also type \"movie*\" to include any movie, regardless of its genre.\n4. **Provide no results** and let users know that no matches were found. This could be displayed in a clear and concise way.\n\nBy offering these options, you can give users the flexibility to search for movies without being limited by the absence of a genre in the context.",
