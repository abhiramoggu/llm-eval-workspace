This gives the user the option to choose a genre even if it is not explicitly stated in the context.\n\n2. **Inform the user that genre is not specified:** Clearly state that the genre is not specified and that the context does not provide any information about it. This gives the user expectations and avoids them from wasting time searching for a genre they may not be interested in.\n\n3. **Offer alternative ways to find the genre:** If the context allows, provide other ways for users to find the genre, such as searching for the movie title or the director's name. This gives the user more flexibility in finding the genre they are interested in.\n\n4. **Return a null or empty value:** Return a null or empty string for the genre field to indicate that the genre is not specified. This allows users to search for movies without limiting their results by genre.\n\n5. **Provide context-based recommendations:** If the context provides any other relevant information, such as the movie's rating or release date, you can use this information to infer the genre.",
