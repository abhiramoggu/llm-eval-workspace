This approach is straightforward but may not be suitable if the context does not provide any clues about the genre.\n\n\n3. **Use a default genre for unknown movies:** For movies for which the genre is not specified and the context does not provide any other clues, you could use a default genre such as \"Unknown\" or \"Genre Not Provided.\" This option provides a neutral response while still giving the user some information.\n\n\n4. **Provide a limited set of genre choices:** Instead of offering a wide range of genres, you could provide a limited set of options, such as \"Action,\" \"Romance,\" or \"Science Fiction.\" This approach can make it easier for the user to choose a genre based on their preferences.",
