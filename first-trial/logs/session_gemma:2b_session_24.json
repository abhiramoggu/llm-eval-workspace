For example, you could provide the year of release or the director's name.\n\n\n4. **Use a machine learning model**: You could train a machine learning model specifically for this task. This model could learn from a large dataset of movies that combine action and intellectual curiosity.\n\n\n5. **Offer a workaround**: If it is absolutely necessary to avoid providing genre information, you could offer a workaround that allows the user to specify the genre explicitly.",
