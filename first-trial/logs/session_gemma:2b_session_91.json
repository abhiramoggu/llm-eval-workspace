This can help to cater to different preferences and interests.\n\n**3.

This gives them more control over the search and can ensure that they are selecting a genre that they are genuinely interested in.\n\n**4. Use natural language processing techniques.**\n\nConsider using natural language processing (NLP) tools to analyze the context and automatically identify the genre. This can be more accurate than traditional methods of genre detection.",
