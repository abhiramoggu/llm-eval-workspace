For example, you could say, \"I'm unable to provide the requested information without further context.\"\n- **Offer a workaround**: If the context provides other relevant information, suggest that the user provide that information instead. For example, if the context mentions a specific movie title, you could suggest that they provide the movie title.\n- **Be transparent**: Let the user know why you cannot fulfill their request, while providing a possible workaround or alternative solution.",
