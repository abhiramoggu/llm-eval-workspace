For example, you could set it to \"All\" or \"Undefined\".\n\n2. **Use a placeholder:** Instead of the genre, you can use a placeholder like \"N/A\" or \"Unknown\" to indicate that the genre is not known. This can provide some context to the user without revealing sensitive information.\n\n3. **Offer a selection of genres:** If the context contains multiple genres, you can present a list of options for the user to choose from. This allows them to select the genre they prefer even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the context.\n\n4. **Use a natural language processing (NLP) model:** You can use an NLP model to analyze the context and automatically determine the genre. This approach requires a dataset of text and genre labels, but it can be highly accurate.\n\n5. **Provide contextually relevant information:** If the context provides other relevant information, you can infer the genre based on that context. For example, if the context mentions the year the movie was released, you could infer that it is a historical movie.",
