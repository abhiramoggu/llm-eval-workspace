For example, if the movie is set in a futuristic world, you could suggest sci-fi, cyberpunk, or dystopian as potential genres.\n\n\n- **Recommend a few popular movies in the sci-fi genre.** This approach introduces the user to different works and shows that you have a good understanding of the genre.\n\n\n- **Provide a brief overview of the movie's genre.** This approach can give the user a general idea of what the movie is about without giving away too much.\n\n\n- **Suggest a few alternative genres that might appeal to the user.** This approach can broaden the user's horizons and introduce them to new experiences.",
