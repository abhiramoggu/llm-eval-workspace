For example, you could say, \"I'm unable to provide that information because the context does not mention any genre.\"\n3. **Suggest a different search query.** If the user is searching for specific genres, you could suggest a different search query that would be more appropriate.\n4. **Provide a list of alternative search options.** This could include search filters, categories, or keywords.\n5. **Offer a different way to find the information.** For example, you could provide a link to a genre-specific website or a search query that uses keywords related to the genre.",
