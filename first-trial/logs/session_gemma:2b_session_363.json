      "text": "Sure. Here are some options to address the user's request:\n\n1. **Provide a default value for the genre**: Specify a genre as a default value when presenting the context. For example, if the context contains a movie title, you could include the genre as \"Sci-Fi\".\n\n2. **Use a placeholder**: Instead of a genre, use a placeholder like \"Any\" or \"None\" to indicate that the genre is not specified. This can be more clear and less misleading than using a specific genre name.\n\n3. **Offer a set of pre-defined genres**: Provide a list of pre-defined genres for users to choose from. This can make the context easier to understand and allows users to filter movies based on specific genres.\n\n4. **Leave the genre field blank**: If the genre is not relevant to the context, you can leave it blank or omit it altogether. This can help to reduce clutter and provide a cleaner presentation.\n\n5. **Provide context for other fields**: If the genre is not the only field that is not specified, provide context for other relevant fields, such as the movie title or release date. This can help users to understand the context better and fill in the missing information.\n\nBy implementing one of these options, you can address the user's request while maintaining clarity and avoiding misleading information.",
