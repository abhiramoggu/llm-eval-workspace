This could help the user narrow down their search and provide a more accurate recommendation.\n\n\n3. **Provide a range of genres to choose from**. This gives the user more flexibility and control over their search.\n\n\n4. **Use keywords or phrases that are indicative of the genre of the passage**. For example, if the passage is about a movie, you could suggest keywords such as \"action,\" \"comedy,\" or \"drama.\"\n\n\n5. **Offer a default genre suggestion**. For example, if the passage is from a wide range of genres, you could suggest a default genre such as \"unknown.\"",
