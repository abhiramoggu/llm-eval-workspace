For example, if they meant to ask about movies, you could suggest \"movies\" or \"films.\"\n2. **Provide a few options to choose from.** If there are multiple genres that could fit the user's intent, offer them as a choice. This gives them more control over the search.\n3. **Use keywords to narrow down the results.** If the user is looking for movies about a specific topic within the romance genre, you could use keywords like \"love story,\" \"soulful romance,\" or \"comedic romance.\"\n4. **Emphasize the importance of context.** Explain that the context does not specify the genre and that it would be helpful to provide more context for a more accurate recommendation.",
