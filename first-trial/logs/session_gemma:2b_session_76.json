Based on your preference, you might enjoy films with themes of fear, suspense, and psychological horror.\n* If you're looking for more intense and atmospheric horror experiences, check out films like \"The Conjuring,\" \"Get Out,\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House.\"\n* For something with a more comedic edge, try \"The Nun,\" \"Halloween,\" and \"Hereditary.\"\n* If you're interested in smaller, independent horror films, I recommend checking out \"The Babadook,\" \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,\" and \"The Invitation.\"",
