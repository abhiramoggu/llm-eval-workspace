This would allow the user to choose a genre even if it's not explicitly mentioned.\n\n\n2. **Highlight other relevant information:** Instead of focusing on the missing genre, you could highlight other aspects of the context that might give the user a clue about the intended genre. For example, you could mention the movie's genre tag, the director's background, or the plot's genre.\n\n\n3. **Offer a suggestion based on the context:** Based on the context, you could suggest a genre that might be relevant. For example, if the movie is set in a specific country, you could suggest the country's genre.\n\n\n4. **Provide a recommendation based on similar movies:** If you have a list of movies with known genres, you could recommend a movie based on its genre. This approach would prioritize recommendations based on genre similarity rather than pure match.\n\n\n5. **Emphasize the importance of genre:** You could emphasize the importance of the genre in the context, explaining that it plays a significant role in defining the movie. This approach would encourage users to consider genre when searching for movies.",
