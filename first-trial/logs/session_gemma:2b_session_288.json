For example, you could default to \"action\" or \"comedy\".\n\n2. **Use a different approach to genre identification.** If the genre is not explicitly mentioned, you could try using other contextual clues, such as the movie's rating or director.\n\n3. **Offer a suggestion for genre exploration.** You could suggest some popular or trending genres that the user might enjoy.\n\n4. **Let the user choose the genre.** If the context allows, you could present the user with a list of genres and let them choose the one they prefer.",
