For example, you could say: \"Please choose a genre.\"\n2. **Use a placeholder value.** You can use a value that is not relevant to the genre, but is known to be a common default choice. For example, you could say: \"Please choose a genre (e.g., All, Drama, Comedy).\"\n3. **Offer a limited set of default genres.** This option can be useful if there are a limited number of genres that are most commonly chosen. For example, you could say: \"Please choose a genre (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action).\"\n4. **Use a dynamic method to determine the genre.** You can use a function or algorithm to determine the genre from other contextual information, such as the movie title or the characters involved.",
