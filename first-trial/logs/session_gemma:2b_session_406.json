This would provide a reasonable default option even if the context doesn't provide any information.\n\n\n2. **Offer alternative ways to specify the genre:** You could allow the user to select from a list of genres, type a keyword, or choose from a dropdown menu. This would give them more control over how they specify the genre.\n\n\n3. **Explain the context limitations:** Inform the user that the context does not provide any information about the genre and that they may need to provide it manually. This would be transparent and allow the user to make the best choice for the context.\n\n\n4. **Offer a workaround:** If it is technically possible, you could offer a workaround that allows the user to provide the genre even if it's not explicitly mentioned in the context. This could involve using a different input method, such as a search field or a free-form text field.\n\n\n5. **Be respectful of the user's time:** If the user is time-constrained, you could provide an estimate of how long it would take to gather the genre information. This could help the user make a more informed decision about whether to proceed.",
