For example, if the passage is about a movie review, you might be able to infer that it is a movie review based on the presence of reviews, opinions, and other relevant elements.\n\n2. **Ask for clarification:** If you're still unable to determine the genre from the context, you can politely ask for clarification from the person who provided you with the passage.\n\n3. **Leave it out:** If the genre is not important to the overall understanding of the passage, you can leave it out and focus on the other aspects that are relevant to your analysis.\n\n4. **Use general terms:** If the genre is not specified, you can use general terms such as \"fiction,\" \"non-fiction,\" \"drama,\" or \"comedy\" to indicate the genre.\n\n5. **Use other clues:** In some cases, the passage may provide other clues that can help you determine the genre, such as the use of certain characters, settings, or themes.",
