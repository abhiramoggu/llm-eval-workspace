The mission was to test American astronaut capability in comparison with the European Space Agency (ESA), which had been in charge of conducting all previous manned space missions around the world. The mission also included sending a radio message back to Earth from the spacecraft's orbit around the Earth, which would allow NASA to confirm that the spacecraft had successfully reached orbit around the Earth. \n\n- \"Treasure Planet\" (2002): This animated movie tells the story of Jim Hawkins, who is a teenager living in the town of Neverland in the United States of America during the late 1960s. Jim Hawkins finds the map of a great treasure hidden by a space pirate named Davy Crockett. Jim Hawkins then sets off with some friends in a large spaceship, shaped like a caravel, on his quest to find and claim this great treasure for himself and the people who live around him in Neverland. \n\nBased on your preferences for genre and plot keywords, I recommend \"The Right Stuff\" (1983) as one movie that you might want to watch based on your preferences for genre and plot keywords.

He' s also wondering what to do about his personal life: does it make sense for him to \"move up\" with his wife Beth and their two daughters from their middle-class lifestyle?
