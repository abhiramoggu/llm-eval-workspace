The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.\n\nAnother option I would recommend is the movie \"You\". The film is a psychological thriller that revolves around two strangers, each of whom is searching for something important in their lives. When these two strangers meet, they begin to interact with each other in increasingly dangerous ways. As this interaction between these two strangers becomes increasingly dangerous and unpredictable, both these strangers are forced to confront their own inner demons and weaknesses in order to survive the increasingly dangerous and unpredictable interaction between these two strangers.",
