The movie's mix of romance, adventure, and espionage will surely transport you to the charming island of Martinique.\n\nIf you're looking for something more modern, I'd recommend \"Ocean's Thirteen\" (2007), a fun and stylish heist film with an all-star cast, including George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The movie's witty dialogue and clever plot twists make it a great choice for anyone who loves French flair!",
