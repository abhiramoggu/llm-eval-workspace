When they finally meet in person, the stranger turns out to be a serial killer with an unusual obsession with horror movies.\n\nThe second movie, \"The Ice Storm\", tells the story of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, growing up in the fictional town of Northwood during winter. The sisters are close but also have their fair share of drama.\n\nAs they grow older, the sisters become increasingly apart from each other. However, one day, a massive snowstorm hits Northwood. The sisters must band together to survive this brutal winter.\n\nIn summary, both \"You\" and \"The Ice Storm\" are excellent movies that offer a unique blend of engaging storytelling and thought-provoking themes. I hope you enjoy watching them.\"",
