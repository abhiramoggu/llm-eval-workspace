This beloved Disney film features stunning animation, memorable characters like Genie and Jafar, and a timeless story of true love and self-discovery.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd prefer a more modern take on the fairy tale genre, \"Beastly\" (2011) is a fun and quirky retelling of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" With its blend of humor, romance, and social commentary, this movie might just surprise you!\n\n(Pearl Harbor and Night Pleasures don't quite fit the fairy tale bill, so I didn't mention those options.)",
