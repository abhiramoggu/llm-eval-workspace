Based on your preference for Hindi language movies, I would recommend \"Windtalkers\" and \"Utsav\". \"Windtalkers\" is a historical drama that explores the use of Navajo code talkers during World War II, featuring a talented cast including Nicolas Cage and Roger Willie. On the other hand, \"Utsav\" is a period drama based on a Sanskrit play from the 2nd century BCE to 2nd Century CE, following the story of a courtesan who hides in a poor man's house and falls in love with him while avoiding the amorous attentions of the king's brother-in-law. Both movies offer interesting plots and great acting performances that I think you would enjoy!",
