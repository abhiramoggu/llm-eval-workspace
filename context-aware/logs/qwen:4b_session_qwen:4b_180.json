This movie is an intense and thought-provoking exploration of what it means to be alive in a world that is increasingly divided by political, economic, and social differences.

When this wealthy man dies unexpectedly, he leaves behind a large fortune and several highly suspicious clues that suggest that this wealthy man was not only involved in illegal activities, but was also responsible for the mysterious disappearance of one of his closest friends.",
