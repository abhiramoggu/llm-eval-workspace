Using her wits and intelligence, Meg manages to convince Auntie to let Meg go back to her own world. \n\n\"The City of Ember\" is an epic science fiction film directed by Peter Jackson, based on the novel \"The City and the Sun\" by Harry Turtledowne, first published in 1902.\n\nIn this epic film, the story is set in the future city of Ember, which has been built upon the ruins of ancient Ember. The residents of Ember are divided between those who believe that the ancient city was destroyed by a mysterious and powerful being known as \"The Dark One,\" and those who believe that the ancient city was simply destroyed by natural forces.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the residents of Ember have been living under false assumptions about the nature of their ancient city. In fact, it turns out that the ancient city of Ember was actually a thriving and advanced civilization that had been operating for thousands of years.",
