If that doesn't quite hit the mark, Wolfhound might be more up your alley, as it's an action-packed adventure with a strong protagonist on a mission for revenge.",

This Alfred Hitchcock comedy is all about the quirks and secrets that come to light when someone dies in a small town. With its cast of lovable misfits, it's a fun and entertaining ride.\n\nIf you're open to exploring something a bit different, I think \"The Wrestler\" (2008) might be up your alley. This drama stars Mickey Rourke as a gruff but lovable wrestler trying to hold on to his past glory. With its themes of redemption and perseverance, it's a powerful and emotional ride.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
