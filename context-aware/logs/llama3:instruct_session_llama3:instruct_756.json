Plus, who can resist the charm of Spidey swinging through Manhattan?\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more offbeat, \"Megamind\" (2010) is a hilarious animated superhero spoof that pokes fun at the genre while still delivering plenty of laughs and excitement. Will Ferrell's voice work as the titular villain is simply genius!",
