The story explores themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, which might resonate with your appreciation for \"Batman Forever\".\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to something more contemporary, I think \"Restless\" (2006) could be a great fit. This indie drama features Mia Wasikowska and Hayley Atwell in a poignant story about young love, identity, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
