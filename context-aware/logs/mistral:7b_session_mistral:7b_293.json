Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece takes place during World War II, but its portrayal of Nazi-occupied France and a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers is certainly riveting. The star-studded cast, including Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and Samuel L. Jackson, delivers compelling performances that make this movie a must-watch.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Apocalypse Now\" is another great choice. This classic war film offers a haunting depiction of the Vietnam War, with an unforgettable performance by Marlon Brando and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The story follows a U.S. Army officer on a mission to assassinate a renegade colonel. It's definitely worth watching for its groundbreaking cinematography and intense narrative.",
