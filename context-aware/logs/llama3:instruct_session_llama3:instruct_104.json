It's a thought-provoking film that explores themes of morality and redemption, with some great performances from its cast, including Russell Crowe and Henry Cavill.

The performances from its cast are top-notch, and the movie's themes of guilt and responsibility will have you thinking long after the credits roll.",

It's a poignant and emotional ride that explores the human cost of conflict.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information or recommendations!",
