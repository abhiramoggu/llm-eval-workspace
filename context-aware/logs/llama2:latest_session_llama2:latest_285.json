If you're interested in a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film with a strong female lead, I would recommend \"Waiting\" starring Drew Barrymore. The movie follows Clare as she navigates her pregnancy and the complex relationships with her friends and old boyfriend. It's a powerful and moving story that explores themes of identity, love, and motherhood.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something action-packed and full of suspense, I would suggest \"Divergent\" starring Shailene Woodley. Set in a dystopian future, the movie follows Tris as she uncovers a sinister plot to destroy Divergents, a group of individuals who don't fit into any one category. With plenty of twists and turns, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat!",
