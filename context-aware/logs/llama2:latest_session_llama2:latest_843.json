The film features an talented cast, including Gregory Sierra, Thomas Ian Griffith, and Sheryl Lee. Alternatively, \"The Only Good Indian\" (N/A) is a powerful and thought-provoking drama that explores the complexities of cultural identity and assimilation in early 20th century Kansas. The film stars Winter Fox Frank as a teenage Native American boy who escapes from a distant Indian \"training\" school and is pursued by a bounty hunter played by Wes Studi. Both of these movies offer thought-provoking and engaging storylines that I think you'll find interesting!",

With a mix of humor, action, and memorable characters, \"The Lost Boys\" is a classic '80s movie that still holds up today.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more offbeat and surreal, I suggest checking out \"Alex in Wonderland\" (N/A). This cult classic stars Paul Mazursky as a struggling filmmaker who becomes obsessed with his own fantasies and daydreams. With a talented cast of characters and a dreamlike atmosphere, \"Alex in Wonderland\" is a thought-provoking and entertaining watch.",
