It's a classic tale of adventure and social commentary that explores what happens when a man from the past travels to the future and finds a dystopian society. The special effects might seem dated by today's standards, but it's still an engaging watch with a thought-provoking premise.\n\nIf you'd like an alternative, I think \"Shattered\" (1973) could be up your alley as well. It's an action-packed thriller that features a clever computer hacker and a cat-and-mouse game between detectives and a ruthless crime boss.",
