Since A Farewell to Arms is a classic novel about love and loss, I'd like to suggest two movies that share similar themes.\n\nFirstly, Winter's Tale (1983) is a beautiful tale of love transcending mortality, with a dash of fantasy. The film stars Peter O'Toole and Jane March in a heartwarming story that explores the power of human connection.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more grounded, On Beauty (2005) could be right up your alley. This documentary follows fashion photographer Rick Guidotti's journey as he leaves the industry to focus on beauty beyond physical appearance. It's an uplifting and thought-provoking film that celebrates individuality.\n\nLet me know if either of these resonate with you!",
