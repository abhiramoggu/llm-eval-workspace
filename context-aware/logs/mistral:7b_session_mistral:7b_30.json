It's a poignant and humorous exploration of youth and relationships.\n\nAlternatively, \"The Trouble with Harry\" is an iconic black comedy from 1955, starring Alfred Hitchcock himself, along with John Forsythe. The plot revolves around the mysterious death of a man named Harry and the absurd events that follow as several townsfolk try to handle his corpse.\n\nEnjoy your movie-watching!",
