I think I have just the right French-inspired films for you!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something gripping and espionage-filled, I highly recommend \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" (2011). The film features a talented ensemble cast, including Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch, and is an adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9's classic novel.\n\nOr, if you prefer something more historical and intense, \"Downfall\" (2004) might be the way to go. This German-French production explores the final days of Adolf Hitler and the collapse of the Third Reich, with outstanding performances from its cast, including Bruno Ganz and Alexandra Maria Lara.",
