The movie revolves around a series of psychological experiments that are carried out by scientists at a remote research facility. The experiments, which are designed to explore the limits of human psychology and to provide insight into the inner workings of the human mind, result in a series of strange and unexpected events that leave the scientists and their subjects baffled and perplexed.\nThe second movie from this list is \"Armageddon\". This is a disaster film that was released in the year 1998. The movie revolves around an oil rig that is drilling into a shallow underwater cave system known as the Devil's Hole. When the oil rig drags its bottom through the Devil's Hole, it creates a massive explosion that rocks the nearby coastline and causes widespread destruction and chaos.\nIn conclusion, both \"Psychic Experiment\" and \"Armageddon\" are two excellent movies that are definitely worth watching.",
