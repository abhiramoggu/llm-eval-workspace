This beloved Pixar film takes a creative spin on what's expected, following two monsters who realize that their entire business model is based on a misconception. With its lovable characters and clever plot twists, it's a great example of how storytelling can be both fun and thought-provoking.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
