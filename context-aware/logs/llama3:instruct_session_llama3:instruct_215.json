Since you mentioned you didn't expect the vibe of Super, I'm going to recommend two movies that might be a good fit.\n\nFirstly, if you're looking for a powerful drama that explores what it means to struggle against a system, I'd suggest checking out We the Living (1936). It's a classic tale of love, loss, and resilience set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. The film features stunning cinematography and thought-provoking themes that are sure to leave you moved.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more contemporary and intense, I'd recommend Man on Fire (2004). This gripping drama stars Denzel Washington as a troubled ex-soldier who becomes embroiled in a child custody battle. It's a tense, emotional ride that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice.\n\nLet me know if either of these resonate with you!",
