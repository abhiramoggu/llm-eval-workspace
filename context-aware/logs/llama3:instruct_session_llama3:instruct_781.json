It's a hilarious and action-packed comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two unlikely friends on the run from hitmen and corrupt cops. The movie is full of laughs, memorable one-liners, and some great chemistry between the leads.\n\nOr, if you're in the mood for something a bit more laid-back and quirky, \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998) might be right up your alley! It's a cult classic that follows Jeff Bridges as \"The Dude,\" a slacker who gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name. The movie has a great cast of characters, witty dialogue, and some fantastic bowling scenes.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
