Alternatively, \"Funny People\" (2009) follows George Simmons (Eric Bana), a seasoned comedian with a terminal health condition, as he takes a relatively green performer under his wing as his opening act. The movie explores the complexities of friendship and mentorship in the comedy world, featuring an impressive cast including Seth Rogen, Jon Brion, and Adam Sandler. Which one piques your interest?",
