With its gritty portrayal and memorable performances, it's a must-see for any fan of music or the 1960s counterculture.\n\nIf you'd like an alternative, I'd suggest \"RocketMan\" (no release date listed), which promises to be a fantastical musical fantasy about Elton John's breakthrough years. With its star-studded cast and Elton John himself involved in the production, it has all the makings of a fun and entertaining ride!",
