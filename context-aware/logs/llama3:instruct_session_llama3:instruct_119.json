If you're looking for more thought-provoking sci-fi, I'd highly recommend \"Interstellar\" - Christopher Nolan's exploration of wormhole travel and the consequences of playing with time will surely resonate with you. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more cerebral, \"Ex Machina\" is a psychological thriller that delves into AI consciousness and raises some fascinating questions about humanity.",
