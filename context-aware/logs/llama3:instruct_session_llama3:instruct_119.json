With Nicolas Cage leading the cast, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat while also tugging at your heartstrings.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more historical epic with stunning visuals, \"Gladiator\" (2000) might be just what you're looking for. Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius is unforgettable, and the film's themes of honor, loyalty, and sacrifice will leave you emotionally invested.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",

This film follows an American soldier who finds himself in 19th-century Japan, where he learns the ways of the samurai and becomes embroiled in a rebellion. With its stunning visuals and poignant themes, it's a great choice for anyone who enjoys action-packed adventures with a touch of spirituality.\n\nLet me know if either of these appeal to you, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
