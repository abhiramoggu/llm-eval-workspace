It's a powerful and intense film that tells the story of the final days of Adolf Hitler, starring Bruno Ganz as the infamous leader. The film is widely praised for its historical accuracy and gripping portrayal of the events leading up to Germany's surrender.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different, I'd recommend \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979). It's a thought-provoking drama that explores the personal and professional struggles of a respected senator, played by Melvyn Douglas, as he navigates the complexities of political life.",

Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more intense, \"Sleepers\" (1995) is a gripping drama that explores themes of revenge and redemption, featuring an all-star cast including Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt.",
