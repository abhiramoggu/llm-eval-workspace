While it's not strictly a film noir, it shares some similar themes of morality and the consequences of playing with fire (literally!). The movie also features a talented cast, including Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, in a thought-provoking sci-fi adventure that explores what it means to be human.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if one of these movies catches your eye!",

The eerie atmosphere, combined with the powerful performances from Ivana Baquero and Sergi L\u00f3pez, will keep you engaged till the end.\n\nSecondly, if you're open to exploring a different genre, I think 300: Rise of an Empire would be an exciting choice.
