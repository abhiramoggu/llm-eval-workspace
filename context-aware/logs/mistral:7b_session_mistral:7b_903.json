This film takes place during a heatwave before the 4th of July, where an action star, a porn star, and a policeman intertwine in a complex web of reality, conspiracy, and virtual reality. It stars an impressive cast including Seann William Scott, Justin Timberlake, and Jon Lovitz, among others.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for something more lighthearted with a touch of humor, \"The Three Stooges\" (2012) might be right up your alley. This film follows the trio as they stumble into a murder plot and wind up starring in a reality television show. It features the beautiful Kate Upton and Larry David. Enjoy your movie night!",
