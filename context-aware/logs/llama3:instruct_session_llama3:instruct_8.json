The film features a strong cast, including Steve Buscemi and Debi Mazar, who bring depth and nuance to their characters.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more cerebral, \"The Shadows\" (2015) might be up your alley. This psychological thriller explores themes of identity, morality, and the blurred lines between reality and fiction, all set against a backdrop of dark poetry.",
