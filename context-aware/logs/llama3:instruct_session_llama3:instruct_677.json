This film features an all-star cast of talented young actors, including Russell Tovey and Dominic Cooper, who are both openly gay men. The story is a witty and charming exploration of teenage identity and coming-of-age themes.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more serious and thought-provoking, I think \"Wonder Boys\" could be an interesting choice. While not explicitly LGBT-themed, the film features a subtle and nuanced portrayal of gay relationships and explores themes of identity, creativity, and human connection.",
