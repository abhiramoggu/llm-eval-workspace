On the surface, it seems like the perfect neighborhood. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. But the pastoral exterior conceals a dark past and an even darker secret.\nAs a group of individuals (each with their own ties and agendas with the town and each other) converge on the enclave, strange things begin to happen. Very strange things. Strange enough to test (and then break) the very fabric of reality itself.\n| Starring:\n- Title: The Lazarus Effect (2015) ) | Plot: A group of medical researchers discover a way to bring dead patients back to life.\n| Starring:\n- Title: Be Kind Rewind (2008) ) | Plot: Two bumbling store clerks inadvertently erase the footage from all of the tapes in their video rental store. In order to keep the business running, they re-shoot every film in the store with their own camera, with a budget of zero dollars.\n| Starring:\nBased on these preferences, I recommend \"Be Kind Rewind\" as it is one of the few movies that are similar to what you shared about \"The Secret\".",
