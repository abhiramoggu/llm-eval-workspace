This quirky film has a similar blend of humor and pathos, following the enigmatic Louie as he navigates his unusual lifestyle. The tricycle-riding protagonist is a fascinating character, and the movie's exploration of identity and community might appeal to fans of \"Volver\"'s exploration of family and relationships.",
