This may also provide some additional common themes with \"Elysium,\" such as the importance of maintaining a positive outlook on life, regardless of whether one encounters various difficulties or challenges in their lives.\n\nIn summary, based on the user's preference cues and genre, I would recommend \"The Santa Clause\" (2004) as a potential second recommendation.",
