If you're interested in a more recent film with a different setting but still packed with action, \"Mama\" (2013) might be worth checking out.

This classic Western follows seven gun-slingers hired to protect a town from bandits. Charles Bronson, Yul Brynner, and Eli Wallach are some of the notable stars in this film.
