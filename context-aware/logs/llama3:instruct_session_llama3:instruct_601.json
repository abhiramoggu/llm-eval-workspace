With a strong cast, including no actors listed as I only see text for this specific title.\n\nAnother option could be \"The Secret\" (1992), which also features complex characters, mystery, and the question of what's real or not. This one has a more intimate setting and explores themes of trust and deception. Genevieve O'Reilly, Ash Cook, and James Nesbitt are the stars you'll meet along this ride.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations!",
