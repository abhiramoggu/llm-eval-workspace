While not directly related to the Iraq War, this film explores themes of war, duty, and humanity through a compelling courtroom drama. Plus, it features an all-star cast including Colin Farrell, Bruce Willis, and Cole Hauser.\n\nIf you're interested in something with a more contemporary feel, I'd suggest \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" (2011). This critically acclaimed film delves into the complexities of war and its human toll during the Bosnian War. The on-screen chemistry between Branko Djuric and Jelena Jovanova is also noteworthy.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or would like more recommendations!",
