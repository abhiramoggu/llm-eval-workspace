This stop-motion animated film is based on Roald Dahl's beloved book and features an all-star voice cast, including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Bill Murray. The story follows the adventures of a clever fox who outwits his farmers' retaliation.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more light-hearted and silly, \"The Nut Job\" (2014) could be a good fit. This animated comedy stars Liam Neeson as a squirrel with a penchant for getting into trouble, and features plenty of humor and action.",
