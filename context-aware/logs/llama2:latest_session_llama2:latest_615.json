The film is a psychological thriller that takes place in Spain, following a man who is haunted by the voices of those who torment him. It's a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie that explores themes of isolation and obsession.\n\nAlternatively, you might enjoy \"True Blood,\" which is a gritty crime drama set in Spain. The film follows a man who is framed for a murder he didn't commit and must navigate a dangerous underworld to clear his name. With a talented cast and a tense, action-packed plot, this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.",
