Based on that, I would recommend \"Unleashed\" (2005) starring Jet Li and Morgan Freeman. It's a powerful and thought-provoking film about a man who escapes his captors and must navigate the world as a free agent. The movie features some great performances, including Jet Li's intense portrayal of a man struggling to find his place in society. Another recommendation would be \"Smokin' Aces\" (2006) starring Ben Affleck, Jeremy Piven, and Ryan Reynolds. It's an action-packed thriller with a complex plot full of twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The cast is excellent, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles.",
