This movie is an exciting crime drama that follows a team of Treasury agents as they try to take down the notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone during Prohibition. The film has a great cast, including Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, and Robert De Niro, and it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more emotional and thought-provoking historical movie, I would suggest \"Beloved\" (1987) starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Angela Bassett. This film is a powerful adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel that explores the legacy of slavery and its impact on the lives of African Americans.",
