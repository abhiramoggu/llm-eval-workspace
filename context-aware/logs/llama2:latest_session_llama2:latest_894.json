If you're in the mood for a spaghetti western, I highly recommend \"White Night\" (2007) starring Bill Fagerbakke and Michael J. Fox. This movie follows an inspector as he re-investigates a long-forgotten murder case that remains mysterious even after years have passed. The film's unique blend of mystery, drama, and crime elements will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a different type of movie, \"The Secret of My Success\" (N/A) starring Michael J. Fox, Bruce McGill, and Mark Margolis is another great option. This film follows the rapid rise of Arthur Tate from a naive constable to a wealthy and respected man, with the help of three women. The movie's lighthearted tone and comedic elements make it an enjoyable watch.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations helpful and enjoy watching one or both of these movies!",
