This cult classic has a great mix of suspense, drama, and supernatural elements, all set against the backdrop of a small Arizona town. The cast, including Randy Quaid and Nick Cassavetes, adds to the film's charm.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or would like more recommendations!",

While its plot may seem absurd at first, it cleverly pokes fun at 80s nostalgia and societal norms.
