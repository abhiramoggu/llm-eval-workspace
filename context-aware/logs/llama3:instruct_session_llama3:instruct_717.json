The film is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and features an all-star cast, including Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Jude Law.

This film offers a fresh take on the Tudor era, with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson delivering memorable performances as the rival sisters vying for King Henry VIII's attention.\n\nWhich one of these historical dramas catches your eye?",
