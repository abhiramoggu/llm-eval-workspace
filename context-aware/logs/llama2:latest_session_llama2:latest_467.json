Starring James Russo, Amanda Wyss, and Judge Reinhold, it's a fun and nostalgic watch.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and uplifting, \"Uptown Girls\" might be up your alley. It's a heartwarming comedy about an adult woman who acts like a child and ends up working as the nanny of an 8-year-old girl who teaches her valuable lessons about growing up. With a talented cast including Marley Shelton, Donald Faison, and Betsy Russell, it's a feel-good watch with plenty of laughs.",
