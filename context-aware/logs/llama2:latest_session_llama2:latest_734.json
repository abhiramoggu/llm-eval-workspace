The film follows a man who sets out on a bike tour of Iceland after a sudden bankruptcy, and learns to let go of his old life and follow his childhood dreams. It's a funny and adventurous movie that explores the themes of freedom and connection with nature.\n\nAlternatively, \"Thank You for Smoking\" (1994) starring William H. Macy, Todd Louiso, and Cameron Bright is also a great choice. This satirical comedy follows the spin doctor for Big Tobacco as he tries to remain a role model for his son while defending cigarettes. It's a witty and entertaining movie that pokes fun at the tobacco industry in a lighthearted way.",
