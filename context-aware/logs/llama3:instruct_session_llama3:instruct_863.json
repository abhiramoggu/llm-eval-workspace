This powerful drama stars Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II, and explores a pivotal moment in her reign when she's faced with tragedy and uncertainty. It's a masterclass performance that will leave you deeply moved.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, \"This Means War\" (2012) is an action-packed comedy with plenty of laughs. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy star as two C.I.A. agents who go head-to-head in an epic battle over the same woman, played by Reese Witherspoon. It's a fun, playful romp that's perfect for when you need a break from serious fare.",

With great performances from David Harbour and Jake Gyllenhaal, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nIf you're interested in a different kind of war movie, \"Windtalkers\" (2002) is also an excellent choice. This film takes place during World War II and follows two U.S. Marines who are assigned to protect Navajo Marines using their native language as a secret code.
