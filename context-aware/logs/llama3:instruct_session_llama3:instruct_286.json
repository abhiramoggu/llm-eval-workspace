Another option could be Smilla's Sense of Snow (1997), which follows an Inuit woman as she unravels the mysteries surrounding a young boy's death in Copenhagen, exploring themes of identity, culture, and justice.\n\nWould you like to explore either of these options further?",

It's a horror film with a unique premise - a group of bikers and their girlfriends are terrorized by a gang of 1950s-style Rockabillies. The atmosphere is tense and suspenseful, and it's definitely a standout in the horror genre.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific questions about these films!",
