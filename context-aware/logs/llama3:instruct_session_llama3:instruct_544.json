Directed by Oliver Stone, this iconic war drama follows a young recruit as he navigates the brutal realities of war in Vietnam. With powerful performances from Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, it's an unforgettable cinematic experience.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in exploring the human side of war, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989) is also an excellent choice. This biographical drama tells the inspiring true story of Ron Kovic, who became a vocal anti-war activist after being paralyzed in Vietnam. With Tom Cruise delivering a standout performance, it's a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film.",
