The movie takes place in an abandoned mental hospital with a dark past, and it's sure to send chills down your spine. With its slow-burning tension and great performances from the cast, you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering what's lurking around every corner.\n\nOr, if you prefer something more action-packed and zombie-filled, \"Planet Terror\" (2007) is a great choice! This campy, gory romp features some amazing practical effects and a star-studded cast, including Rose McGowan and Robert Rodriguez. You'll be laughing and screaming in equal measure as the survivors try to take down the hordes of undead.",
