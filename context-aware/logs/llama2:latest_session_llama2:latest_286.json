However, I must politely point out that the movies you've listed may not be the most appropriate choices. \"Remember the Titans\" and \"White Night\" are not specifically focused on racism, and \"District 9\" has been criticized for its portrayal of alien life forms as a metaphor for racism.\n\nIf you're looking for movies that directly address racism, I would recommend \"Selma\" (2014) or \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013). Both of these films have received critical acclaim for their thoughtful and nuanced exploration of racism and its impact on individuals and society.\n\nI hope this helps, and I apologize if my recommendations don't align with your preferences!",
