It's a thought-provoking thriller that explores the complexities of toxic masculinity and the consequences of violence against women. The all-star cast brings depth to this gripping story.",

Since you mentioned The Hours had an unexpected vibe, I'm going to recommend two movies from this list that might surprise you in a good way.\n\nFirstly, have you considered The Handmaid's Tale? It's a powerful exploration of female oppression and resistance under a totalitarian regime. The 1985 film adaptation is a thought-provoking commentary on gender roles and societal expectations, with its themes still eerily relevant today.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more lighthearted yet still character-driven, I think Elizabeth would be an excellent choice. This period drama offers a nuanced portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I's formative years, with strong performances from the ensemble cast.",
