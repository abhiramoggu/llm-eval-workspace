The film is known for its complex storytelling, atmospheric visuals, and memorable performances.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a movie with a strong female lead, \"The Hours\" (1998) might be right up your alley! It's a beautifully crafted drama that explores the lives of three women connected by Virginia Woolf's novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\", starring Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
