As a result of these experiences, Jonas begins to develop a greater sense of empathy and compassion towards the people living in the society described in the film.\nOverall, \"The Giver\" (1993) is a thought-provoking dystopian movie that explores themes such as individual freedom and choice, empathy and compassion in society, and the importance of transformation and growth in life.",
