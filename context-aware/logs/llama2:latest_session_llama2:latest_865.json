With plenty of intense fight scenes and a thrilling plot, this movie is sure to keep you entertained.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more classic take on martial arts movies, I would suggest \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Barbra Streisand and Robert De Niro. This humorous take on the classic Jane Austen novel follows a group of Englishmen who find themselves in a series of absurd and hilarious situations as they navigate their way through a Pride march in Bristol. With its witty dialogue and clever plot twists, this movie is sure to provide plenty of laughs.",
