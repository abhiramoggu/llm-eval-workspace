It tells the story of a world where reality is a deception, and artificial intelligence plays a central role. Keanu Reeves delivers an unforgettable performance in this sci-fi classic.\n\nIf you prefer a more recent film, \"Transcendence\" is another great choice. This movie explores the dangerous implications of uploading a human consciousness into an AI system, featuring Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman.

If you're interested in exploring similar ideas, I'd recommend 'Zero Effect'. It's a clever mystery about a genius detective who uses unconventional methods to solve complex cases. As for ensemble cast movies, 'What Women Want' might be right up your alley. It's a comedy where a chauvinistic executive gains the ability to hear women's thoughts, leading to some eye-opening experiences! Enjoy the films!",

If you're interested in something a bit different, \"The Skull\" is another intriguing movie that stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, known for their work in classic horror films.
