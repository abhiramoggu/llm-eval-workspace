The film features an ensemble cast with memorable performances. Another interesting choice is \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (2008), which tells the rags-to-riches story of a young man from the slums who becomes a contestant on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' - both are engaging and deeply rooted in Indian culture. Unfortunately, 'Maleficent', 'The Whistler', 'Elysium', and 'Afterlife' aren't set in India, so they don't quite align with your preference cues. Enjoy the cinema!",
