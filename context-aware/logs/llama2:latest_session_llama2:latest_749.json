The plot follows a senator who arranges for his son to be kidnapped by two black actors pretending to be murderers in an attempt to shock him out of his plans to become a rapper. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try! \ud83d\ude04\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and quirky, \"Yoga Hosers\" might be up your alley. It's a fun and offbeat movie about two teenage yoga enthusiasts who must battle an evil presence that threatens their major party plans. The film features an interesting cast of characters, including Natasha Lyonne and Johnny Depp, and it has a great mix of humor and action.
