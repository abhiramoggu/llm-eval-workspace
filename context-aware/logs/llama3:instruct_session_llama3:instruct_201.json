This iconic film is based on a true story and features Rod Steiger, Margot Kidder, and James Brolin, among others. The eerie atmosphere and supernatural events will keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern and humorous, I'd suggest \"This Is the End\" (2013). This apocalyptic comedy stars James Franco, Seth Rogen, and other celebrities playing themselves, which adds to the hilarity. While it's not strictly a haunted house movie, there are plenty of creepy moments to enjoy!",
