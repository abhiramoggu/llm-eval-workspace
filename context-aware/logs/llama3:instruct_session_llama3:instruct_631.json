It's a classic and intense film that takes place during the Cuban Missile Crisis, with a star-studded cast including Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson. The plot is quite gripping, as a group of American teenagers must fight against the Soviet Union to protect their hometown.\n\nIf you're looking for something more recent, I'd recommend \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (2012). Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film is based on real events and follows the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden. The all-star cast includes Jessica Chastain, Joel Edgerton, and Chris Pratt, among others.\n\nLet me know if either of these catches your eye!",
