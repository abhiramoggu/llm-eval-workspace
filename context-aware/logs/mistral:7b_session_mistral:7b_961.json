This action-packed film is set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear holocaust, and features an intriguing plot involving human-machine hybrids caught between the warring factions of humans and machines.

While not a direct nuclear holocaust film, it features a small town grappling with the consequences of nuclear experiments on one woman's body, causing quite a stir in the village. This horror classic stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and Drew Barrymore, among others. Enjoy the films!",
