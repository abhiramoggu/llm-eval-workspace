This film brings together iconic characters from literature and history, with Hugh Jackman as the titular Van Helsing, a skilled monster hunter. It's an action-packed ride with plenty of thrills and chills.\n\nAlternatively, if you're up for a more modern take on the monster genre, I think \"Cloverfield\" would be a great choice. This found-footage film puts you right in the midst of a monster attack on New York City, with a group of friends fighting to survive. The shaky camera work and real-time storytelling make it feel like you're experiencing the chaos firsthand!",
