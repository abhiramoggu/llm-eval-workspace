With great performances from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, this movie is sure to send chills down your spine!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more old-school, I highly recommend \"Creepshow\"! This 1982 anthology film is a must-see for any horror fan, featuring five gruesome tales from a kid's comic book about all sorts of terrifying things. With an all-star cast including Ed Harris and Stephen King himself, this movie is a wild ride that's sure to satisfy your horror cravings!",
