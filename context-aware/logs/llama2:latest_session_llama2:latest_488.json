Based on your preference for a movie with a British setting and plot keywords like \"British\" and \"could,\" I would recommend \"True Blood.\" The film is a gritty and intense drama that explores themes of crime, family, and redemption in a British setting. Additionally, the talented cast featuring Ray Trueblood (played by Idris Elba) and Billy Masters (played by Kurt Loder) makes for an engaging watch. Another recommendation would be \"Get Him to the Greek,\" a comedy that follows the hilarious misadventures of an out-of-control rock star and his intern. The film features a talented cast, including Russell Brand and Katy Perry, and is sure to provide plenty of laughs.",
