It's a psychological thriller that explores themes of grief, obsession, and identity, with an incredible performance by Natalie Portman at its center. The film's dark and moody atmosphere will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more light-hearted, I'd also recommend \"Mrs. Doubtfire\"! It's a classic comedy that stars Robin Williams as a lovable but eccentric actor who goes undercover as a housekeeper to be close to his children. With its witty humor and heartwarming moments, it's a great choice for a feel-good movie night.",
