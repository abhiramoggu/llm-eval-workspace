The film takes place in a future where the wealthy live in a space station while the rest of the population resides on a ruined Earth, and follows a man's mission to bring equality to the polarized worlds. The movie explores themes of social inequality and the struggle for justice, making it an thought-provoking and engaging watch.\n\nAlternatively, you might enjoy \"Mansfield Park\" (1814), a period drama that follows the life of Fanny Price, a young woman born into poverty who is sent to live with her wealthy uncle and his family. The film explores themes of class and social status, as well as the challenges of navigating high society. With a talented cast and a thought-provoking plot, \"Mansfield Park\" is sure to keep you engaged and entertained.",
