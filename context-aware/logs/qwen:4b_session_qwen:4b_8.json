In particular, it became clear that these newly introduced species were not actually the ones they claimed to be, but instead were actually another entirely different set of creatures that were completely unrelated to them in any way shape or form at all. As a result of these unintended consequences, things quickly go from bad to worse. The zoo's population becomes increasingly unhappy and frustrated as time passes, with many of the\u52a8\u7269\u56ed's inhabitants becoming completely disillusioned and despondent about everything. In short, after this experiment has had its unintended consequences, things will quickly turn from bad to even worse than they already are right now.",
