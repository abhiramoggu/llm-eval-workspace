This movie is about a man who dies in an accident and enters Heaven. But when he discovers that his beloved wife Annie has killed herself out of grief over the loss, he embarks on an afterlife adventure to reunite with her.\nThe other movie I recommend you watch is \"The Adjustment Bureau\" (2011) directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. This movie is about a man who dies in an accident and enters Heaven. But when he discovers that his beloved wife Annie has killed herself out of grief over the loss, he embarks on an afterlife adventure to reunite with her.\nHowever, you can also choose to watch \"The Beastmaster\" (1982) directed by Roger Vadim. This movie is about a sword- and- sorcery fantasy about a young man' s search for revenge. Armed with supernatural powers, the handsome hero and his animal allies wage war against marauding forces.\nThis movie has been well-received by both critics and audiences alike and it is considered to be one of the greatest sword-and-sorcery fantasy movies ever made.\nI hope this recommendation helps you enjoy watching these great romantic fantasy movies.",
