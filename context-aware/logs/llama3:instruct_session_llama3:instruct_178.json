This film cleverly tackles relationships and politics through the story of a political consultant trying to explain his past to his 11-year-old daughter. With Ryan Reynolds as the lead, it's a fun and light-hearted ride.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted and comedic, \"The Secret of My Success\" (1987) might be up your alley. This movie follows Michael J. Fox as Arthur Tate, a naive constable who rises to fame with the help of three women, all while exploring themes of power, politics, and social status.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
