This classic sci-fi film explores the themes of humanity and what it means to be alive, all set against a backdrop of advanced technology and genetic engineering. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a blade runner tasked with tracking down advanced androids known as replicants.\n\nOr, if you're in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted, \"Hitch\" (2005) might be up your alley! This romantic comedy stars Will Smith as a professional date doctor who helps men woo the women of their dreams. The film's themes of love, relationships, and genetic engineering are all woven together in a charming and witty way.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
