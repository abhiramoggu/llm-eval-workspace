The story follows a washed-up golfer trying to qualify for the U.S. Open, and it's got some great cameos from real-life golf pros like Phil Mickelson.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for something quite so light-hearted, \"Hitch\" (2005) is also an option. It's not strictly about golf, but Will Smith plays a charming professional date doctor who helps people find love - and it's got a fun golf-themed plot twist!",
