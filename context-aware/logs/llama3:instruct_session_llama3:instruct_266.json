Since you liked the sound of \"Flyboys\", which is an action-packed World War I film, I'm going to suggest two movies that share a similar tone and excitement.\n\nFirstly, I recommend \"Planet Terror\" (2007) directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's a thrilling zombie movie with plenty of action, gore, and even some humor! You'll love the rag-tag group of survivors fighting against hordes of infected creatures. The cast features Josh Brolin, Rose McGowan, and Bruce Willis, among others.\n\nSecondly, if you're in the mood for something more sci-fi oriented, I suggest \"District 9\" (2009). This thought-provoking film takes place on Earth, where an alien species is forced to live in slums. You'll be engaged by the unique blend of social commentary and thrilling action sequences, starring Sharlto Copley.\n\nWhich one of these two movies catches your eye?",
