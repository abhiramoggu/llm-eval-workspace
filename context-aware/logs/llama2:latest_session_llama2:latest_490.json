If you're looking for a movie with a similar mix of comedy and suspense, I would recommend \"Dear John\" starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. The film follows a young woman who is stalked by a psychotic manic and finds refuge with a group of transvestites who are not what they seem. It's a funny and thrilling ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more dramatic and thought-provoking, I would recommend \"The Equalizer\" starring Denzel Washington. The film explores the moral ambiguity involved with private detective work and how one man uses his skills to fight against injustice. It's a gripping and well-acted movie that will keep you engaged from start to finish!",
