Alternatively, \"Gone with the Wind\" (1936) is a classic romantic drama set during the American Civil War and Reconstruction periods, featuring an all-star cast including Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.

The plot follows a group of individuals who converge on an idyllic community, only to discover a sinister secret lurking beneath the surface. It has a similar atmospheric and suspenseful tone to \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\nAlternatively, if the user is interested in a movie with a more comedic tone, I would suggest \"American Dreamz\" starring Perrey Reeves, Noureen DeWulf, Aldis Hodge, and Seth Meyers. The plot follows a group of individuals as they navigate their way through a political campaign, with plenty of humor and satire thrown in. It has a similar feel to \"Gone with the Wind\" in its exploration of human relationships and politics.",
