It tells the story of a troubled taxi driver who becomes obsessed with saving a young prostitute, offering a gripping portrayal of urban decay. The movie features stellar performances by Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster.\n\nSecondly, \"Jane Eyre\" (1847) is a classic novel-turned-film that takes place in England.
