It's a thrilling and thought-provoking movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, if you're interested in a movie that explores the challenges faced by small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, I would suggest \"Chain Reaction\" (1996) starring Beth Grant and Oliver Platt. The film provides an intimate look into the struggles of entrepreneurs in a time of crisis and how they adapt to survive.
