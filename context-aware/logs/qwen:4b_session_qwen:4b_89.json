The movie revolves around an encounter between two famous directors - Alfred Hitchcock and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\n\nThe encounter is memorable for both Hitchcock and Truffaut. Hitchcock was impressed with Truffaut's talent and dedication to his craft. Truffaut, on the other hand, was fascinated by Hitchcock's ability to create suspense and tension in his films.\n\nThe encounter between Hitchcock and Truffaut is considered one of the most famous encounters in the cinema history. The encounter has also been immortalized in numerous books, articles, and documentaries.",
