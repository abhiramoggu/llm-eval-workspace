The film features a group of patients who escape from a mental institution, and the camaraderie and the psychological journey of the characters are compelling.\n\nFinally, if you're interested in a lighter and more comedic film, then \"Funny Break\" might be the perfect movie for you. The movie features a group of inmates who go on a wild escapade, and the humor is well-paced and engaging.",
