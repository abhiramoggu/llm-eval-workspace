The movie takes the audience through the twists and turns of Amy's life, leading up to her murder trial.\n\nMy second recommendation would be \"The Machinist\" which is a psychological thriller directed by David Fincher and based on the novel of the same name written by Patrick Kennedy.\n\nThe movie follows the story of Richard Foster Grant, who is suffering from severe delusions and headaches. The movie takes the audience through the twists and turns of Richard's life, leading up to his breakdown and eventual suicide.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Gone Girl\" and \"The Machinist\" are both excellent psychological thriller movies that offer plenty of twists and turns, ultimately leading up to their respective climaxes.",
