Perhaps Mrs. Tate had a grander plan for herself.\nAnother recommendation could be \"The Newton Boys\" which stars Liam Neeson and is based on a novel by James E. Rees Jr. The story follows the Newton gang, the most successful bank robbers in history, owing to their good planning and minimal violence.\nAgain, you can mention the plot or actors to make it more interesting.",
