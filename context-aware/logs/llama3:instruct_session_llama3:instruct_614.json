Directed by Randall Wallace and starring Mel Gibson, this film tells the story of the first major battle of the Vietnam War, and it's a powerful tribute to the soldiers who fought on both sides.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more unconventional, with plenty of action and style, then \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009) might be just the ticket. Directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Brad Pitt, this film takes place during World War II and follows a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers as they take on the Nazis in some pretty creative ways.",
