(1980) - This classic comedy features a neurotic pilot dealing with a variety of humorous situations, including a bizarre food poisoning incident on board the plane. It's a fun watch and has a memorable cast.\n2. 'Compliance' (2012) - A fast-food restaurant becomes the setting for an unsettling drama involving manipulation and deception. This film will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.",
