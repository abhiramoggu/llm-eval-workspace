The group, including scientists Dr. Ian Malcolm and Dr. Richard Atwood, have been sent to the island by billionaire entrepreneur John Hammond in order to study the behavior of endangered species. However, after John's arrival on the island, he discovers that the dinosaurs were previously extinct due to an asteroid impact which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs except for T-Rex. However, since the appearance of a large dinosaur egg (which is later revealed to be the result of an earlier asteroid impact which also wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs except for T-Rex)) on the island, John is forced to take his group and leave the island before they are killed by the dinosaurs.  | Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Bill Paxton, Sam Neill, Laura Dern",
