Since you liked \"Her\" and its exploration of deeper themes, I'd like to suggest two movies that might resonate with you.\n\nFirstly, I think \"Looper\" would be a great match. This sci-fi thriller explores complex moral dilemmas and features a standout performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The movie's themes of time travel and human connection will likely appeal to fans of Spike Jonze's work in \"Her\".\n\nSecondly, if you're looking for something entirely different, I'd recommend \"Easy A\". This charming comedy-drama shares some of the same wit and humor found in \"Her\", and its exploration of identity and relationships might strike a chord with you.\n\nWould you like to give either of these a try?",
