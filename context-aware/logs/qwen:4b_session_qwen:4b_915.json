Almost fifteen years pass and the lead inspector, now approaching retirement, reflects on the only case he could not solve in an otherwise successful career. Haunted by a sense of responsibility and guilt that he caused suffering by letting the murder case go unsolved, he decides to re-investigate.\n\nHis persistent search brings attention to the long forgotten case and reveals a hidden relationship between the victim'",
