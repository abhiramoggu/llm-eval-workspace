The reason for my recommendation is that the movie \"Divergent\" revolves around the concept of Divergence and how it affects different factions based on virtues. The main character, Tris, discovers that she is Divergent and will not fit in with the other factions based on virtues. This leads to a plot filled with action, suspense, drama, and even humor. The movie \"Divergent\" stars the talented actors: \n- Isaiah Washington, also known as Isaiah Washington III, III, is an American actor who is best known for his role as Dr. Daniel Lin in the 2014 American science fiction film \"Ender's Game\". He has also appeared in other films such as \"The Cell\" (2000), \"The Crow\" (2006), and \"The Walking Dead\" (2015). \n- Keith Hudson, known professionally as Keihard Hudson, is an American actor who is best known for his role as Terrence \"Terry\" Washington in the 1983 American drama film \"Crossing Jordan\". He has also appeared in other films such as \"The King's Speech\" (2010), \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\" (2014), and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\" (2019). \n- Nancy Allen, commonly known as Nancy Allen III or simply Allen, is an American actress who is best known for her role as Carol Jackson in the 1986 American adventure comedy film \"Air Force One\".
