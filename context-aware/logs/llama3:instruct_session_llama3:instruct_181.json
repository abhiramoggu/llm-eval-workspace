The plot revolves around a sound recordist who stumbles upon evidence of murder, which puts him in harm's way.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring other genres, \"RoboCop\" (2014) is an action-packed sci-fi film that features Nancy Allen alongside a talented cast, including Peter Weller. The movie explores themes of identity and humanity, which might resonate with you after experiencing the emotional resonance of Rocky.\n\nLet me know if either of these appeal to you!",
