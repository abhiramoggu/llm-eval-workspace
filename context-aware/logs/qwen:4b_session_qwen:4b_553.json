They then switch places, leading to a series of comedic misadventures. The acting in this movie is also well done, with standout performances from John Malkovich as the Prince and Nathan Lane as the Pauper. Overall, \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1881) is a delightful and entertaining comedy that should be enjoyable for fans of both classic and contemporary literature.",
