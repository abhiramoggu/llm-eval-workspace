It's a witty and insightful film about the absurdities of pursuing a dream and the lengths people will go to for success.\n\nIf you're interested in a more melancholic and existential film, check out \"Groundhog Day\" (1993). Harold Ramis delivers a captivating performance as a self-centered weatherman stuck in an endless cycle of repeating one day.\n\nIf you'd like something with a more experimental approach, \"Lady in the Water\" (2006) is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film about the complexities of relationships and gender roles in modern society.",
