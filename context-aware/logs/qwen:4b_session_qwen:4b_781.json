The movie has received positive reviews for its exploration of moral ambiguity involved with private detective profession, and how he works with deep- pocketed criminals to finance his fight against injustice.\n\n\"Find Me Guilty\" is another movie that I'd like to recommend to you. This movie tells the story of a young single woman named Jan Tucker who is instrumental in uncovering the wide use of false testimony by LAPD using jailhouse informants during the 90' s. The movie has received positive reviews for its exploration of moral ambiguity involved with private detective profession, and how he works with deep- pocketed criminals to finance his fight against injustice.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations interesting and helpful!",
