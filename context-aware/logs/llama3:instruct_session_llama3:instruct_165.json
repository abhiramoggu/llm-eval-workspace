It's a powerful and emotional film that tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saves the lives of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust. If you've already seen that one, another great option might be \"12 Years a Slave\", which is a harrowing but important portrayal of the experiences of enslaved African Americans in the 19th century.",
