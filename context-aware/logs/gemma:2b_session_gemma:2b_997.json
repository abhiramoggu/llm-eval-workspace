The film is visually striking and has a strong cast, but it is not for everyone.\n\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) is a high-octane adrenaline rush about a group of criminals taking a young woman hostage and entering a cross-border road race to get to Mexico before the police catch them. The movie is fast-paced and exciting, but it also has a serious side.\n\nNext Day Air (2009) is a darkly humorous crime comedy about two inept criminals who are mistaken for a package of cocaine and start a chain of events that changes the lives of 10 people. The film is witty and clever, but it is also a bit sad.",
