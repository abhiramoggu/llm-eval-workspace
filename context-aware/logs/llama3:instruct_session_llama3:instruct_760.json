It's a classic tale of ghostly retribution, with Viggo Mortensen starring as a vengeful spirit seeking justice from beyond the grave. Plus, it's a great chance to see Viggo in one of his earlier roles!\n\nOr, if you're looking for something a bit more action-packed and fantastical, \"The Beastmaster\" (1982) might be up your alley! With Marc Singer as the heroic beast-master, this sword-and-sorcery epic is all about seeking revenge against marauding forces. And who knows, you might even spot some familiar animal allies along the way!\n\nLet me know if either of these options appeal to you, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
