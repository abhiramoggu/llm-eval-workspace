It's a quirky and hilarious film that perfectly captures the spirit of a revenge movie. With Bill Murray at the helm, you can expect plenty of witty one-liners and absurd situations as he sets out to exact revenge on that pesky shark.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more serious, \"Rob Roy\" might be up your alley. This period drama stars Liam Neeson as the titular character, an outlaw seeking revenge against those who wronged him. With its stunning Scottish landscapes and themes of honor and loyalty, it's a great choice if you enjoy a good historical epic.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",

Plus, it stars some amazing actors like Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more nostalgic and heartwarming, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is always a great choice. It's a timeless classic that explores the what-ifs of life and the importance of human connection - all set against the backdrop of a small American town in the 1940s.
