The film features an talented cast, including Dev Patel and Freida Pinto, and it's a must-see for anyone who loves a good story well-told. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat and psychological, I recommend \"In the Woods.\" It's a thought-provoking and unsettling film that explores the themes of identity and reality through the lens of a group of monsters living in an urban forest.
