Plus, Mandy Moore's voice acting as Rapunzel is simply delightful!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more classic and romantic, \"The Age of Innocence\" (1920) might be the way to go. This timeless tale of love and social norms features stunning period settings and a talented cast, including Norman Lloyd and Claire Bloom.\n\nLet me know if either of these catches your eye!",
