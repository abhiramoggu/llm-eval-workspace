Leslie Mann plays his co-worker and friend, adding some great comedic relief to the film.\n\nIf you're open to something a bit different, \"Restless\" (2006) is also worth considering. It's a coming-of-age drama that explores themes of relationships, freedom, and finding one's place in the world. Leslie Mann plays a small but memorable role as Tiina's mother, adding some warmth and humor to the film.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
