This Quentin Tarantino film is set during World War II and features an ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz, and Samuel L. Jackson. The plot revolves around a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers on a mission to assassinate Nazi leaders, intertwining with a theater owner's personal vengeance against the Nazis. Another remarkable movie is \"Schindler's List,\" a powerful story about Oskar Schindler's efforts to save his Jewish workforce during the German occupation of Poland in World War II, featuring a stellar performance by Liam Neeson.
