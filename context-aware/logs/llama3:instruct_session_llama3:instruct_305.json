The atmosphere is moody and introspective, but the chemistry between the leads makes it a must-watch.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something lighter, \"Horrible Bosses\" (2011) might be more your speed. This raunchy comedy stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis as three friends who concoct a plan to off their awful bosses - but things don't go exactly as planned!
