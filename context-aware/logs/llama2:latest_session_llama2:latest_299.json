This romantic comedy follows a successful actress who stays with a wealthy family in New York City and finds herself entangled in a web of complex relationships. The film's mix of witty dialogue, quirky characters, and unexpected plot twists should appeal to fans of Drake Doremus' unique storytelling style.\n\nAlternatively, I would suggest \"Alex in Wonderland\" (N/A) starring Angelo Rossitto, Jeanne Moreau, Paul Mazursky, Ellen Burstyn. This film is a surreal and imaginative exploration of a movie director's fantasies and the blurring of reality and fiction. The cast's excellent performances and the dreamlike atmosphere of the movie should delight viewers looking for something offbeat and thought-provoking.",
