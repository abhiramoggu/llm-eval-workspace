It may not be directly about football, but it's an iconic biographical drama that explores the life of General George S. Patton, and features powerful performances from George C. Scott.\n\nIf you're open to something a bit more unconventional, I'd suggest \"Creepshow 2\".

Or if you prefer something more light-hearted, you might enjoy \"Jerry Maguire\" (1996), which is a sports-themed comedy-drama starring Tom Cruise as a sports agent who has a crisis of conscience.\n\nWould either of these movies pique your interest?",
