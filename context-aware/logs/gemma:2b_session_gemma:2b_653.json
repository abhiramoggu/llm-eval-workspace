It's a hilarious and witty take on the classic Hitchcock film of the same name.\n\nIf you're interested in a more serious and thought-provoking film, then \"Armageddon\" (1998) starring Eddie Griffin is a great option. It's a thought-provoking and visually stunning film about a group of scientists fighting for humanity's survival against a supercomputer.\n\nIf you're looking for something more action-packed and thrilling, then \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009) starring Michael Papajohn is a great choice. It's a fast-paced and exciting film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
