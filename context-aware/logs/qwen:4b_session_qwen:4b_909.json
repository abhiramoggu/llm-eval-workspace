This movie is a modern adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic novel, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The movie features a heavily neurotic young man who starts seeing his father's ghost. While he helps the spirit cross to the otherworld, something happens that they could never achieve in their common life: they finally understand each other. The movie stars Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Tim Pigott- Smith as her father, Nicky Katt as a young man named Stevie Morris who works with Alice and helps guide her through this surreal journey of self-discovery, enlightenment, and ultimate understanding of the universe and all its wonders.",
