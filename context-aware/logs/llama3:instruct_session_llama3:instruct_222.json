With an all-star voice cast including Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary, you'll be giggling from start to finish!\n\nOr if you're in the mood for something a bit more classic and fantastical, \"Shrek 2\" (2004) is a great choice. This sequel to the original Shrek film takes us on a wild ride as Shrek and Fiona travel to the Kingdom of Far Far Away and encounter all sorts of wacky characters along the way. With its witty humor and lovable characters, you'll be singing \"I'm like an onion\" in no time!",
