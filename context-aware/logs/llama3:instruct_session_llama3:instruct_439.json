It's an iconic film that launched Tom Cruise's career and features high-octane action, romance, and memorable characters like Maverick and Goose. With its blend of adventure and drama, it's a classic that still holds up today.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit darker, \"Batman Returns\" (1992) is another great option. This sequel to Tim Burton's original \"Batman\" film brings back Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader and introduces Michelle Pfeiffer as the alluring Catwoman. With its gothic atmosphere and memorable villains, it's a must-see for any superhero fan.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations!",
