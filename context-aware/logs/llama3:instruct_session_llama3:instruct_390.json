The film's atmospheric tension and nuanced performances will keep you engaged from start to finish.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and focused on relationships, \"Restless\" (2006) might be up your alley. It's a coming-of-age story about finding connections with others, starring Mia Wasikowska as a free-spirited young woman. The film's youthful energy and strong performances make it an enjoyable watch.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
