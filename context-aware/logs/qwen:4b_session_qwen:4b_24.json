The movie tells the story of two lovers, a young woman who was abandoned in childhood and an aging man who had no children. They fell in love with each other, but their relationship became very complicated and eventually ended up in tragedy.\nOn the other hand, \"In Time\" is another classic true crime movie directed by James Mangold and starring Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert Duvall.\nThe movie tells the story of a man who has stopped aging at 25. He uses his skills as an arms dealer to buy his way out of the situation. However, he realizes that his actions have consequences, both for himself and for others around him.",
