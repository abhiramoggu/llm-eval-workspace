Based on your preference for autobiographical novels, I would recommend \"The Bell Jar\" and \"Elysium.\" Both movies deal with themes of identity, inequality, and the struggles of individuals in a society that is not always just or fair. \"The Bell Jar\" is a powerful adaptation of Sylvia Plath's novel, exploring the mental health struggles of its protagonist through a unique blend of drama and surrealism. On the other hand, \"Elysium\" is a thought-provoking sci-fi film that examines the consequences of unchecked capitalism and the widening gap between the haves and have-nots in a dystopian future society. Both movies feature strong performances from their casts and offer plenty of food for thought.",

Alternatively, if you're looking for something more recent but still in the same vein, \"Paycheck\" is an action-packed thriller with a great cast, including Ryan Robbins and Krista Allen.",
