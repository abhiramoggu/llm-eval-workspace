The movie has a unique blend of humor and poignancy that might resonate with you.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more light-hearted, \"Passion\" (2011) could be a great choice. It's a documentary that celebrates individuality and self-expression through competitive beard growing! Who wouldn't want to see that?\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
