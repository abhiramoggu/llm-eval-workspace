If you're in the mood for a gritty, intense crime movie, I'd highly recommend \"Goodfellas\" (1990) - it's a classic tale of organized crime and the rise and fall of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta. Alternatively, if you prefer a more modern take, I think you'd really enjoy \"Sicario\" (2015), a tense thriller about a DEA agent who finds herself in the middle of a drug cartel war, starring Emily Blunt.",

It's a classic crime drama that shares some similar themes and intensity with Sicario, and it features an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. If you're up for something a bit more recent, Training Day is another great option - it's a gritty and suspenseful thriller that explores the moral gray areas of law enforcement.",
