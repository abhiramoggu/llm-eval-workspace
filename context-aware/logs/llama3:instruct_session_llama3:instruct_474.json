The film has a great mix of action and suspense, making it an exciting watch.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more grounded in reality, I also recommend \"Three Kings\" (1999). It's not a traditional auto racing movie, but it features some amazing wheelchair and hand cycle racing scenes, set against the backdrop of a thought-provoking story. Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney star in this critically acclaimed film.",
