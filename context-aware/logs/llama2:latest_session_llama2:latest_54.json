The film follows a group of scientists who are voted to lead the world in a post-apocalyptic future, with poetic themes of power and responsibility. Alternatively, \"The Whistler\" (2016) is a haunting tale of revenge and defense, starring a gentle giant who will stop at nothing to protect his love.
