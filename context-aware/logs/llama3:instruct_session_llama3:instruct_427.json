This gritty drama is based on true events and features a talented cast, including Ohad Knoller and Kel O'Neill. It's a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the devastating consequences of war.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more unconventional, I'd suggest \"Catch-22\" (1970). This classic film is a dark comedy that explores the absurdities of war through the eyes of Alan Arkin's character. It's a cult classic that has stood the test of time and might just surprise you with its humor and wit.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
