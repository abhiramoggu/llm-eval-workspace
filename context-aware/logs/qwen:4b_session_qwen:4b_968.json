In its previews, the movie is considered a critical, artistic, and surefire commercial success, so Alex seemingly has his choice of what his next project will be. Alex has a few ideas, like a biopic of Lenny Bruce or a movie about a black uprising in Los Angeles. As he makes the rounds to both the Hollywood community and European movie centers for ideas, he fantasizes about movie scenarios of his everyday situations, influenced by his movie idols, some of whom he actually meets, like Italian director Federico Fellini",

This movie is a powerful and emotional story about seven U.S. astronauts who were selected for a mission that would test the human capacity to withstand extreme conditions. The movie follows the seven astronauts as they train in California and prepare for their flight to space. During the flight, the astronauts experience a range of extreme conditions, including hypothermia, dehydration, and even partial amnesia. Despite these challenges, the astronauts work together effectively and maintain their composure throughout their mission.
