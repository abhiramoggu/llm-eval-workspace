The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and it's a sweet story that will make you smile.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for romance, I'd also recommend \"The Buried Giant\". It's a beautiful adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, with stunning visuals and a poignant story about memory, aging, and connection. The chemistry between Tom Wilkinson and Kelly Macdonald is lovely, and it's a thoughtful film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",
