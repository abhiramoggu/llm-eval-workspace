Kennedy. The all-star cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Oldman, brings to life the intriguing true story. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more personal and emotional exploration of historical events, \"Wilde\" is a powerful drama that sheds light on the turbulent life of Oscar Wilde and his struggle with his sexuality. Both of these films are engaging and well-crafted pieces of cinema that I highly recommend!",

It has a unique blend of humor and imagination that I think you'll enjoy.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a movie that explores the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses, I suggest \"Chain Reaction\" (1996).
