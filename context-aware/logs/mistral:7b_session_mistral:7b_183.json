The cast, including David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Jeremy Irvine, delivers exceptional performances that truly bring the story to life.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in exploring some of the complexities of the Russian Revolution, \"We the Living\" offers a gripping portrayal of three individuals caught up in its turmoil. Ayn Rand's novel comes alive on screen with performances by Corbin Bernsen, Joanne Whalley, and Tom Berenger.
