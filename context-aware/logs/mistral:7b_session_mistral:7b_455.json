The film stars Jeff Bridges as The Dude, alongside a stellar cast including John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Dazed and Confused\" offers a nostalgic look at the last day of high school in 1976, filled with the carefree spirit and experimentation of youth. This coming-of-age film features an impressive ensemble cast, including Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, and Parker Posey.
