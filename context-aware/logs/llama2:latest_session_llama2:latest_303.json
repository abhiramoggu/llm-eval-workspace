If you're in the mood for a spaghetti western, I highly recommend \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) starring Claudia Cardinale and Henry Fonda. This classic western is known for its sweeping landscapes, memorable characters, and iconic score by Ennio Morricone. Alternatively, if you're interested in something a bit more modern and darker, \"Maleficent\" (2014) starring Angelina Jolie Pitt is a great choice. The film offers a fresh take on the classic Disney tale, with impressive visual effects and a compelling performance by Jolie Pitt as the titular character.",

It's a thought-provoking and intense drama that explores themes of mental health and the human psyche.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more nostalgic, Once Upon a Time in America (1984) is a classic gangster film that follows a group of aging mobsters as they reflect on their past lives and regrets. With an all-star cast including Robert De Niro and James Russo, this movie is sure to keep you engaged and emotionally invested until the very end.",
