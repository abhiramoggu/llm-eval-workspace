Veronica Mars is a classic teen noir that follows the story of a high school student who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, while Alex in Wonderland is a more experimental film that explores the life of a struggling filmmaker navigating the ups and downs of Hollywood. Both are definitely worth checking out if you enjoy the sound of Veronica Mars!",
