It's not your typical royal drama, but it does have a quirky storyline involving a mysterious curse and a complex protagonist. Plus, it features a talented cast, including Shia LaBeouf and Patricia Arquette.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something with a more serious tone, I think \"End of Watch\" could be up your alley. It's a gritty, intense police thriller that explores the daily struggles of two young officers in LA. The documentary-style filmmaking adds to the authenticity of the story, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives a standout performance.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
