Based on your preference for world cinema and the plot keywords you provided, I highly recommend \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006).

The film features stunning visuals, a gripping plot, and a talented cast, including Ivana Baquero and Sergi L\u00f3pez. If you're looking for something lighter but still with great production value, \"Hotel Transylvania\" (2012) is another excellent choice.

Both of these films are sure to provide a thought-provoking and entertaining cinematic experience!",
