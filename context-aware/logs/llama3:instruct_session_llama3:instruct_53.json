With a clever plot and a dash of humor, this film features Guy Pearce as a wrongly accused prisoner who must rescue the President's daughter from an outer-space prison. Plus, it has a great cast, including Vincent Regan and Joseph Gilgun.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more cerebral and suspenseful, I think \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" (2011) is an excellent choice. Based on John le Carr\u00e9's classic novel, this film stars Gary Oldman as George Smiley, a veteran espionage agent tasked with uncovering a Soviet spy within MI6. It's a gripping and thought-provoking movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat!",
