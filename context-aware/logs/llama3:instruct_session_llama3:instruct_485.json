It's a thought-provoking drama that explores themes of identity and human connection. While robots aren't featured prominently, the film's exploration of what it means to be alive might resonate with you.",

With a critically acclaimed performance by Scarlett Johansson and a thought-provoking storyline, \"Her\" is a beautiful and poignant film that I think you'll enjoy.\n\nIf you'd like to explore more options, I could also suggest \"Madame Bovary\" (1856), which is the original story that inspired the name of your movie.
