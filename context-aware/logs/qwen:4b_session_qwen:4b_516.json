While he helps the spirit cross to the otherworld, something happens that they could never achieve in their common life: they finally understand each other.\nThe actors in this movie are also very talented. Corbin Bernsen is one of the most famous actors in Hollywood, and he does a great job in this movie as the young man who starts seeing his father's ghost.\nGlenn Morshower is another actor who does an excellent job in this movie as the young man who starts seeing his father's ghost.\nOverall, \"Afterlife\" is a very interesting and entertaining movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in watching a good and entertaining movie like \"Afterlife\".",
