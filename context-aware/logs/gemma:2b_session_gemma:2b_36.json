The movie explores a complex and emotional story about a young Albanian immigrant's return to his native village.\n\nAlternatively, if you're seeking a lighthearted and humorous movie, then \"The Perfect Score\" (N/A) starring Vanessa Angel and Erika Christensen is a good option. The movie follows a group of high school students who decide to break into the Princeton Testing Center to get perfect scores on their SAT exams.\n\nIf you're interested in a historical drama about a powerful and influential woman, then \"Elizabeth\" (1998) starring Fanny Ardant and Eric Cantona might be worth checking out. The movie depicts the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I of England and her task of learning what she needs to be a monarch.",
