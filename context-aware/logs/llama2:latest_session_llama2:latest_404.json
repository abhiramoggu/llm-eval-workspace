If you're in the mood for something with a thrilling plot and exciting action scenes, then \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" might be the perfect choice for you.

Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more cerebral and thought-provoking, then \"Yesterday Was a Lie\" might be up your alley. This mind-bending movie stars Chase Masterson as a brilliant but troubled young woman who finds herself on the trail of a reclusive genius, only to discover that reality is much more complex and surreal than she ever imagined.",

The plot is gripping and the performances are top-notch, with James Wilcox delivering a standout performance as the enigmatic main character.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a movie that explores the darker side of human nature, \"End of Watch\" (2016) is worth checking out. This gritty and intense cop drama follows two young officers as they navigate the dangerous streets of LA, encountering corruption and violence at every turn.
