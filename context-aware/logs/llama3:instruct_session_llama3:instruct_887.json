It's a great choice if you're looking for a thought-provoking film that will make you reflect on your own relationships.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more futuristic and action-packed, I'd also suggest \"Minority Report\". This sci-fi thriller is set in a world where crimes can be predicted and prevented, but it's Tom Cruise's John Anderton who finds himself framed for a murder he didn't commit. It's an intense ride with plenty of twists and turns!",
