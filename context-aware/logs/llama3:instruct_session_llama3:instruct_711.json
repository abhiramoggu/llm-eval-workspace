The movie follows two monsters who discover that children aren't as scary as they thought, and it's got a great cast of characters, including John Goodman and Billy Crystal.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more laid-back and quirky, I'd also recommend \"Louie\". It's a charming documentary-style film that delves into the story of Louie Evans, a man who rides around Boston on his tricycle yelling out what some people call a 'siren noise'. It's a really unique and offbeat film that explores themes of identity and community.",
