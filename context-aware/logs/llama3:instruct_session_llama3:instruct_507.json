With its strong cast and timeless story, it's a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking autobiographical drama.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more recent, I'd also recommend \"The Hours\" (1998), which weaves together the stories of three women connected by Virginia Woolf's novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\". With an all-star cast including Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore, it's a powerful exploration of identity, mortality, and the power of literature.",
