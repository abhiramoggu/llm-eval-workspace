This intense drama will keep you on the edge of your seat as you follow the journey of a struggling artist turned prizefighter. And J.K. Simmons' Oscar-winning performance is definitely worth checking out!\n\nAs for \"A Night at the Roxbury\", it's a fun and light-hearted comedy that's all about chasing your dreams - but if music isn't your thing, it might not be the best fit.\n\nAnd while \"Amadeus\" is an incredible film, it might not fit the bill since it's more of a historical drama rather than a music-focused movie.
