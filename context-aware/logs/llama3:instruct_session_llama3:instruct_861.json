It's a quirky comedy that pokes fun at small-town life and features a star-studded cast, including Alfred Hitchcock himself. The film's tone is quite different from \"The Passion of the Christ\", but it shares a similar sense of curiosity and investigation into what happened to someone who has passed away.",
