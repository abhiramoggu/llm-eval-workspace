It's a gripping thriller with a great performance from Dennis Quaid as a detective trying to track down a new serial killer who seems to be mimicking an execution he witnessed earlier. The plot is clever and keeps you guessing until the end!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more unique, I'd also recommend \"The Lovely Bones\" (2002). It's a haunting and emotional film that explores the story of a young girl who's murdered and watches over her killer from purgatory. The film features stunning performances from Saoirse Ronan and Rachel Weisz.\n\nLet me know if you're interested in either of these movies, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
