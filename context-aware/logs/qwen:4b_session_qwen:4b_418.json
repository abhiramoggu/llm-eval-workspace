As he struggles to come to terms with what happened to him, Max discovers that there are people out there who have been subjected to a similar kind of treatment by Rekall. As Max starts to piece together the truth about what happened to him and the people around him, Max realizes that in order to truly escape from the horrors of his past, Max must confront and overcome the demons within himself.",
