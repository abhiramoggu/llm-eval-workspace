It's a fascinating historical period drama that explores the life of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, with Keira Knightley delivering a stunning performance as the aristocrat. The film also features an all-star cast, including Ralph Fiennes and Dominic Cooper.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more fast-paced and suspenseful, I think \"Argo\" (2012) would be a great choice. Directed by Ben Affleck, this gripping drama tells the true story of a CIA agent who goes undercover to rescue six Americans during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 - it's a real nail-biter!",
