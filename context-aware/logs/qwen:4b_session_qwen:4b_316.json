This classic film from 1994 tells the story of two teenage girls who share a unique bond; their parents, concerned that the friendship is too intense, separate them, and the girls take revenge. With its fast climbing Arthur Tate rose to his fame, wealth and respectability quickly from a beginning as a naive constable His rise was also due to 3 women: dressmaker Violet Lawson, Lily, the Baroness von Lukenberg, and movie producer Marigold Marado, His rise was also due to Mrs. Tate, who always seemed to have an extra bit of information which would make her suggest to the people that her son Arthur be provided a position where he could do more good. Perhaps Mrs. Tate had a grander plan for herself.\nI hope you find this recommendation helpful!",
