It's a classic lesbian film from the 90s, starring Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon as two women who get caught up in a scheme to steal mob money. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and it's a great example of a well-crafted thriller with strong female characters at its center.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more recent, \"The Hours\" is also a fantastic choice. While not exclusively a lesbian film, it explores themes of identity and intimacy through the experiences of three generations of women - including a lesbian couple played by Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.",
