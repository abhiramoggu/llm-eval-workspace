This iconic sci-fi film explores the themes of humanity and what it means to be alive through its portrayal of advanced androids known as replicants. With Harrison Ford leading the cast, this movie is a must-see for anyone interested in AI.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more recent and family-friendly, I suggest \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001). This beautifully crafted film tells the story of David, a highly advanced robot boy who wants to become human. With Haley Joel Osment's endearing performance as David, this movie is sure to tug at your heartstrings.\n\nWhich one catches your eye?",
