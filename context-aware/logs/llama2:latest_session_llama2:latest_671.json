It's a thrilling ride with plenty of twists and turns to keep you engaged. Alternatively, if you're looking for something with more action and sci-fi elements, I suggest \"District 9\" (2009) starring Sharlto Copley and Jason Cope. It tells the story of an extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth and their encounter with a government agent exposed to their biotechnology. Both movies offer a unique and exciting experience!",
