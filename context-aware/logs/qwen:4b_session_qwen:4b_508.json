He claims to be pursued by certain authorities who intend to prevent him from disclosing a secret that only he holds, whence the title. Is he lying, or insane  - or is he telling the truth? Who, if anyone, is after him? And what  *is*  - the secret?\nThis movie tells an interesting story about a stranger who enters into and forever alters the life of a couple. The actors in this movie are also quite talented, making it even more enjoyable to watch. Overall, I would highly recommend the movie \"The Secret\" to anyone who enjoys watching movies that tell interesting stories about people.\nThank you",
