      "text": "I think I can suggest a couple of German language movies that might interest you!\n\nFirstly, while not entirely in German, \"The Monuments Men\" (2014) has some great scenes set in Germany during World War II. The film stars George Clooney and an all-star cast, and it's a thrilling tale about a group of art historians who go behind enemy lines to rescue priceless works of art.\n\nIf you'd like something more specifically in German, I think \"Bend It Like Beckham\" (2002) is a great choice! Although not set in Germany, the film features two talented British actresses, Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, in a heartwarming story about ambition, family, and football.",

It's a sassy and sexy film with great chemistry between Angelina Jolie Pitt and Antonio Banderas as they navigate a complex game of love, deception, and betrayal. The movie has a similar feel to \"Bend It Like Beckham\" in its exploration of themes that go deeper than the surface level.\n\nIf you're looking for something else, I'd also recommend \"Just Married\"! It's a fun, lighthearted romantic comedy that follows a young couple as they face challenges and obstacles on their honeymoon. The movie has a great cast and some hilarious moments to boot.",
