It's a gritty and atmospheric film that explores themes of gender, power, and identity through the eyes of a detective investigating a series of mysterious disappearances. The cast is also quite impressive!\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more lighthearted and action-packed, I'd suggest \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969). It's a classic Western comedy that features two iconic leads - Paul Newman and Robert Redford - as they lead a band of outlaws on a thrilling adventure.",
