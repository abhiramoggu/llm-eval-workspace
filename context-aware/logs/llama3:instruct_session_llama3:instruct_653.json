This iconic film is a masterclass in absurdity, following King Arthur's hilarious quest for the Holy Grail.

This time-traveling comedy has a similar irreverent spirit to Monty Python, with a dash of nostalgia for the '80s. The cast, including John Cusack and Rob Corddry, deliver plenty of laughs as they try to navigate their way back to the present while avoiding changing the course of history.",
