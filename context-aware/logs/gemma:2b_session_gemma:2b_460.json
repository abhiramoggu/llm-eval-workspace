It's about a group of friends questioning their loyalties after sharing a strange artifact.\n\nIf you're interested in a heartwarming and unconventional family story, \"Yours, Mine and Ours\" is a perfect pick. It's about a widower falling for a widow with eight children, who must decide about forming a huge, unique family.",
