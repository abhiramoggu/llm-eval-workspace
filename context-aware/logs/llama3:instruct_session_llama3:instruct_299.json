It's a beautifully shot and thought-provoking film based on John Knowles' classic novel, set during World War II. The themes of jealousy, betrayal, and coming-of-age will likely resonate with you.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more period-specific, \"A Tale of Two Cities\" might be the way to go! This 1935 adaptation stars Ronald Colman and is a faithful retelling of Charles Dickens' beloved novel. The story of love, sacrifice, and social commentary set against the backdrop of the French Revolution is simply captivating.\n\nWhich one piques your interest?",
