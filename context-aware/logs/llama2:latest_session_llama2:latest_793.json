The film features an impressive cast, including Natalie Zea, Lindsay Sloane, Thomas Middleditch, and Derek Jeter.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and comedic, \"The Other Guys\" might be up your alley. It's a hilarious buddy cop movie that stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as two mismatched detectives who try to solve a crime while dealing with their own personal struggles.
