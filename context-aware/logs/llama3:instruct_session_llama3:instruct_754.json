It's a classic murder mystery film starring Clint Eastwood as Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan, who must stop a killer targeting San Francisco celebrities. The movie has a great blend of action and suspense, and it's a fun ride with Eastwood at the helm.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different, I'd recommend \"Cause of Death\". It's a lesser-known murder mystery film that explores themes of love and loyalty as a deputy-district attorney investigates the murder of a mayor's cousin. The movie has a great cast, including an actress who would later become a household name (Demi Moore!).",
