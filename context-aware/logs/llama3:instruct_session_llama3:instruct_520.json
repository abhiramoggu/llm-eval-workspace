Plus, it stars Bruce Campbell, who's become synonymous with the genre.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more recent, I'd suggest \"ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction\" (2009). This indie film offers a unique take on the zombie apocalypse, set in a quiet island town where the undead outbreak catches everyone off guard. With its lighthearted tone and nods to classic horror, it's a great choice for those who want something a bit more offbeat.",
