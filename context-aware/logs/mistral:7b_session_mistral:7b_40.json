Starring Tiago Riani, Melissa Benoist, and Hayley Lovitt, it's a beautiful story that combines love, wisdom, and the power of stories passed down through generations.\n\nAnother option you might enjoy is \"Oliver Twist,\" which is more focused on drama and romance within a group of friends. It's an adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel and features a tangled web of lust, betrayal, and blackmail that unfolds in Victorian England. While it doesn't have the same romantic focus as \"The Longest Ride,\" it's certainly a captivating watch!",
