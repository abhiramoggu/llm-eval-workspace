This quirky comedy follows four siblings as they navigate family dynamics and features an impressive ensemble cast, including Sarah Silverman and Rainn Wilson. The movie's themes of family secrets and misunderstandings might also appeal to your appreciation for complex stories.\n\nI won't suggest \"The Expendables 2\" or \"Pitch Perfect\" since they're quite different in genre and tone from what you've been looking for.",
