Redline (2001) - This is a modern documentary that focuses on three triathletes from the same small town training for the triathlon World Championships. One of the athletes, Bill Chaffey, was training for his first Olympic distance triathlon when he was involved in a horrendous accident that left him a paraplegic. For four years he trained himself in the disciplines of wheelchair and hand cycle racing to complete his dream of completing a triathlon and representing Australia in a World event while remaining just one of 100 boys. Director Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui focuses on the lives of these three athletes, Bill Chaffey, and Dominique Simonnette, who have trained for this major event for several years now. The documentary explores various aspects related to the preparation and competition in the triathlon World Championships. One interesting aspect that is explored in the documentary is the various challenges faced by the three athletes, Bill Chaffey, and Dominique Simonnette, during their preparation for this major event.",

The movie stars Taylor Swift, who plays the lead role of Tris Prior. The movie is set in a world divided into factions based on virtues such as courage, compassion, and wisdom. In this world, Tris learns that she's Divergent - someone with abilities beyond what most people are capable of - and that she won't fit in with the other factions. As Tris and her fellow Divergents try to find out more about their abilities, they become embroiled in a plot to destroy Divergents. In order to stop this plot, Tris and the other members of her faction must work together and uncover the secrets of Divergent abilities.",
