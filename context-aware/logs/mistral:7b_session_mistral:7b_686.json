This film portrays the life of Queen Elizabeth II after the tragic death of Princess Diana, and features an outstanding performance by Helen Mirren who won an Oscar for her role as the queen.\n\nAnother great choice from your list is \"The Shining\". A classic in the horror genre, it's a chilling tale of a family's descent into madness while staying at an isolated hotel haunted by sinister forces. It stars Jack Nicholson and features a memorable score by Wendy Carlos that complements the eerie atmosphere perfectly. Enjoy your gothic movie night!",
