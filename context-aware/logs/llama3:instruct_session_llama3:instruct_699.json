With Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N\u00e9lisse delivering standout performances as the leads, you're in for a thrilling and unsettling ride.\n\nIf you'd like to explore another option, I think \"Smokin' Aces\" (2006) could be up your alley. This action-comedy has a similar blend of dark humor and high-stakes action, following a group of hitmen trying to take out a snitch who's decided to cooperate with the authorities.
