I think you might really enjoy \"Minority Report\" (2002) - not only is it a visually stunning film with impressive special effects, but the unique premise of predicting crimes before they happen raises some fascinating questions about free will and morality. Tom Cruise's performance as John Anderton adds to the movie's tense and thrilling atmosphere.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more classic, \"Escape from New York\" (1981) is a cult favorite that offers a gritty and action-packed take on a dystopian future. Kurt Russell stars as Snake Plissken, a tough-as-nails convict who must navigate the ruins of Manhattan to rescue the US president. The movie's blend of science fiction and exploitation elements makes it a fun ride!",
