This movie follows five different criminals who botch a job quite badly. With the press of a button, a wooden box bestows riches and death.\n\n2. \"The Box\" (2006). In this movie, a park ranger and his girlfriend run into a young man in the middle of Death Valley desert. He shoots the ranger, kidnaps the girl and starts playing psycho-sexual games with her. The wounded ranger gets a shotgun and goes after them.\n\nI hope you find these movies interesting and suitable for your mood!",
