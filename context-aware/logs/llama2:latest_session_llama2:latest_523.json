In \"You\", a gentle giant stands up against a group of thugs who threaten the peaceful town he loves. I hope you find these recommendations helpful!",

The film follows an artist who agrees to carry a child for another couple, and as the birth draws near, she begins to have second thoughts about giving up her baby. It's a powerful and moving story with great performances from the cast.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for something a bit more quirky and intellectually stimulating, then \"I Heart Huckabees\" might be more up your alley. This film is a comedy-drama that follows a husband-and-wife team of detectives who help others solve their existential issues.
