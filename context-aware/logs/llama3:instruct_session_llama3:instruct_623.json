With Marc Singer leading the charge as the titular beastmaster, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and humorous, I think \"Your Highness\" (2011) might tickle your funny bone. With James Franco and Danny McBride playing two bumbling princes on a quest to rescue their sibling's bride, this movie is packed with laughs and swashbuckling action.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or preferences that might sway my recommendations!",
