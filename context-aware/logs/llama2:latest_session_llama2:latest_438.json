Alternatively, if you're interested in a more modern take on the \"mystery\" genre, I would suggest \"Takers\" starring Chris Brown and Paul Walker. The movie follows a group of bank robbers who find their multi-million dollar plan interrupted by a hard-boiled detective, with plenty of high-octane action and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.",

The film explores the complex relationship between a piano teacher and her pupil, delving into themes of obsession, control, and sexual tension.
