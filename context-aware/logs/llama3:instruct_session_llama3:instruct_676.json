Firstly, you might enjoy \"Sholay\" - it's a classic Bollywood film with Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan, and Hema Malini, which features thrilling chases, memorable characters, and a dash of mythological flair.\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I'd suggest \"Vampyres\" (no relation to the actual White Night, but what a fascinating premise!). This 1966 horror film stars Bessie Love and Michael Byrne in a creepy tale of vampiric sisters preying on unsuspecting victims. The eerie atmosphere and strong female leads might appeal to you!",

It's a classic Bollywood romance with a great story about two people who pretend to be in a relationship, but actually have real feelings for each other. With its lighthearted tone and beautiful settings, it's a great choice if you're looking for something fun and romantic.\n\nIf you'd prefer something a bit more dramatic, I think \"Taxi Driver\" could be up your alley. It's a gritty film that explores themes of love, loneliness, and the darker side of human nature - all set against the backdrop of 1970s New York City.
