Who is he? Why does he ride? Interviews with the employees of Back Bay Bicycles, the store that does complimentary repairs for Louie' s bike, and Louie himself outline the mysterious  'trike rider' s life as a dedicated bicyclist and as a compassionate, misunderstood person. \n\nOn the other hand, \"The Violent Kind\" is an intense and disturbing movie that follows the story of a small group of hardened young bikers and their girlfriends are tormented when one of the girls becomes savagely possessed and a gang of  \"Rockabillies\" seemingly from the 1950' s descends upon them to collect what is growing inside her. \n\nI hope these recommendations meet your expectations.",
