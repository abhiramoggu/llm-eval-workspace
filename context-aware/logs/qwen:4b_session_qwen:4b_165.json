Here are two movie recommendations from the thriller genre, with a softer touch:\n\n1. \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2007) directed by David Fincher and starring Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander.\n\nThis psychological thriller based on Stieg Larsson's novel series is well-known for its intricate plot, strong characters, and tense atmosphere. While it can be quite disturbing at times, it also offers plenty of insights into the human psyche, relationships, and power struggles.\n\nTherefore, if you are looking for a psychological thriller with a softer touch, then \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is definitely worth checking out!\n\n2. \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring David Bowie as Alex Deewitt, and Michael Caine as John Ewing.\n\nThis dystopian psychological thriller based on William Shakespeare's play \"Othello\" is well-known for its bleak and oppressive atmosphere, its complex and morally ambiguous characters, and its thought-provoking themes of power, jealousy, identity, and morality.\n\nTherefore, if you are looking for a dystopian psychological thriller with a complex and morally ambiguous cast, and a thought-provoking theme of power, jealousy, identity, and morality, then \"A Clockwork Orange\" is definitely worth checking out!",
