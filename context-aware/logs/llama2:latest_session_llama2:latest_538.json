It's a hilarious and thought-provoking film that features an all-star cast, including Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck, and Matt Damon. The movie follows two renegade angels who try to exploit a loophole and reenter Heaven, while a worker at an abortion clinic is called upon to save humanity's existence. I think you'll find it both entertaining and thought-provoking! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more recent, \"What Just Happened\" could be another great choice. It's a comedy-drama that follows a professor who relocates to Nigeria in search of love and adventure, but ends up getting lost and encountering all sorts of obstacles along the way. The movie features a talented ensemble cast, including Robert De Niro, Robin Wright, and Kristen Stewart, among others. I think you'll find it both funny and poignant! \ud83d\ude0a",
