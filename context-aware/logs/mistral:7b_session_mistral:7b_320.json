This is a children's literature movie that tells the story of Stanley Yelnats, who gets sent to a tough juvenile detention camp in Texas as punishment for a crime he didn't commit. The film combines adventure, humor, and thought-provoking themes about justice and family history.\n\nIf you're also interested in exploring stories about strong-willed characters navigating challenging times, \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" is another excellent choice. Set in Oregon, it follows the Hauer brothers as they face threats to their traditional logging business, making for a compelling tale of resilience and family bonds.",
