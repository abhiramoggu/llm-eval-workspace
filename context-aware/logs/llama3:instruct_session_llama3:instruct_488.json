This iconic film tells the epic tale of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler set against the backdrop of the Civil War and Reconstruction. With its stunning cinematography, memorable characters, and sweeping romance, it's a must-see for any movie lover.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more historically accurate, I suggest \"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\" (1979). This biographical drama follows the life of the 26th President of the United States from his early days as a politician to his role in the Spanish-American War. It's a fascinating look at one of America's most beloved leaders.",
