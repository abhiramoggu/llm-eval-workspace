The movie takes place in a Sydney boxing gym, where two women are pitted against each other in a battle of honour and tradition. It's got a great cast and a compelling plot that explores some really interesting themes.\n\nIf you're looking for something with a bit more historical flair, \"Downfall\" (2004) might be the way to go. This German drama follows Adolf Hitler's final days as he descends into madness and chaos in the bunker beneath Berlin. With an all-star cast including Bruno Ganz and Alexandra Maria Lara, this film is a gripping portrayal of one of history's most tumultuous periods.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
