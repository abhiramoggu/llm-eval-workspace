It's a gripping thriller about a man who becomes increasingly obsessed with a novel he believes was written about him, and as the story unfolds, it takes some surprising twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end.\n\nAlso, \"Michael Clayton\" is another fantastic option. This film features George Clooney as a fixer for a law firm who gets entangled in a dangerous web of corporate intrigue, deceit, and manipulation. It's a smart, suspenseful thriller that offers a thought-provoking commentary on the world of big business and the lengths people will go to protect their interests. Enjoy!",
