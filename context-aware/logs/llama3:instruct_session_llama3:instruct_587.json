This French drama explores themes of desire, control, and sexuality through the complex relationship between a piano teacher and her student. With Isabelle Huppert's powerful performance, it's a must-watch.\n\nIf you prefer something a bit more lighthearted and character-driven, \"Restless\" (2006) could be a great choice. This coming-of-age drama follows a young man as he navigates his relationships with others and himself, all while exploring the complexities of human desire.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
