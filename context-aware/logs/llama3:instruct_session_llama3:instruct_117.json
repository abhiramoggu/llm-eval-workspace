It's a classic crime drama that's both intense and poignant, following the rise and fall of Henry Hill, a mobster played by Robert De Niro (who also stars in \"The Godfather\"!). If you enjoy that one, I'd also recommend \"Sicario\", a more recent film that explores the dark world of Mexican drug cartels through a cat-and-mouse game between FBI agents and cartel members.",
