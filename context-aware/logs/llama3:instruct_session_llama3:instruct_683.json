The film has a great mix of humor and heart, and it's a fun take on the buddy comedy genre.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more action-packed, \"Shattered\" (1973) might be up your alley! It stars Corbin Bernsen as Peter Smith, the boss of two detectives who are trying to take down a Russian crime boss. The film has a great 70s vibe and some exciting plot twists.\n\nLet me know if you have any other preferences or if you'd like more recommendations!",
