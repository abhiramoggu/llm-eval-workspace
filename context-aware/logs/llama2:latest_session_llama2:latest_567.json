The movie follows Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman and his battle against the villainous Ra's al Ghul and Scarecrow. It has a similar dark and gritty tone to \"Titanic\" and features an all-star cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and Katie Holmes.\n\nAlternatively, I would suggest \"Super\" (2010) starring Rainn Wilson as a struggling comic book artist who becomes a superhero after discovering a magical suit. The movie has a quirky and offbeat tone similar to \"Alex in Wonderland\" and features a talented cast, including Ellen Page and Kevin Bacon. It's a fun and entertaining watch with a unique blend of humor and action.",
