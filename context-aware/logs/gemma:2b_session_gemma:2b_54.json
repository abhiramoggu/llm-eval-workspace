It's a compelling story about an American diplomat and a Russian refugee, with beautiful performances from Lynn Redgrave and Natasha Richardson.\n\nI would recommend Wilde if you're looking for something more biographical and focused on a single person's struggles. Catch-22 is a darkly comedic and satirical film about a man's desperate attempt to escape the horrors of war.\n\nLittle Lord Fauntleroy is a charming and heartwarming story about a young boy's journey to find his family.",
