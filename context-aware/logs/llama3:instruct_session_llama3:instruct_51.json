It's a gripping story about a law student who becomes a lieutenant during World War II and gets caught up in a complex case of racial tensions within the prisoner-of-war camp. The cast is impressive, featuring Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis.\n\nIf you're looking for something entirely different, I'd suggest \"Eve's Bayou\" (1997). It's a beautifully crafted film that explores themes of family secrets, mysticism, and lies in a gothic setting. Romola Garai isn't actually in this one, but the stunning Tamara Tunie is part of an all-star cast.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
