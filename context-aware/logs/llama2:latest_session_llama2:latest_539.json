It's a short but inspiring narrative doc that explores the world of beard growing and the man behind it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're in the mood for something a bit more action-packed and adventurous, \"Bad Boys II\" might be up your alley. This movie follows two loose-cannon narcotics cops as they investigate the flow of Ecstasy into Florida from a Cuban drug cartel. With an all-star cast including Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, this film is full of high-octane action and hilarious moments. Let me know if you'd like to learn more about either of these movies!",

Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted but still with great acting, \"Lucky You\" might be up your alley.
