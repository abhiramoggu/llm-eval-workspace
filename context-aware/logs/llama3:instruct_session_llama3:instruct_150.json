This drama explores themes of trauma, revenge, and redemption through the lens of two childhood friends seeking justice after being brutalized at a detention center. With an all-star cast, including Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt, it's a gripping and emotionally charged experience.\n\nLet me know if either of these resonate with you, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
