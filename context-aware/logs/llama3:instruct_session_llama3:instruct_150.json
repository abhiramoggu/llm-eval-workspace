This 1997 film is a must-watch, especially since it's considered one of the pioneering films in the LGBTQ+ genre. You'll love the quirky humor and relatable themes.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to something more contemporary and heartwarming, \"The Kids Are All Right\" is an excellent choice. This 2010 movie features a talented cast, including Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo, and explores the complexities of non-traditional family dynamics with humor and sensitivity.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more recommendations!",
