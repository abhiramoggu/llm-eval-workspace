This Oscar-winning film tells the incredible true story of Philippe Petit's high-wire walk between the Twin Towers in 1974. With amazing archival footage and interviews with those involved, this documentary is an absolute thrill ride!\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more thought-provoking documentary, \"The Blood of My Brother\" (2005) might be up your alley. This powerful film explores the life and tragic death of Iraqi portrait photographer Ra'ad, offering a poignant glimpse into the human cost of war.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
