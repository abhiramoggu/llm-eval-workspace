With an all-star cast, including Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake, it's a must-watch to learn more about the social media phenomenon that changed the world.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more historical, I'd recommend \"The New World\". This visually stunning film tells the story of Pocahontas and John Smith's famous encounter in 17th-century Virginia. With Colin Farrell and Q'orianka Kilcher leading the cast, it's an epic tale that explores cultural clashes and romance.",
