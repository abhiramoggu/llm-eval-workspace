This sci-fi action film stars Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck as astronauts who must save the world from a giant asteroid. With its pulse-pumping action sequences and memorable performances, it's a classic 90s blockbuster that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more fantastical, I'd suggest \"Maleficent\" (2014). This visually stunning fantasy film reimagines the classic Disney tale from Sleeping Beauty with Angelina Jolie Pitt bringing the iconic villain Maleficent to life. With its richly detailed world-building and compelling performances, it's a must-see for fans of the genre!\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
