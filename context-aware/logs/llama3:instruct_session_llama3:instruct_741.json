This animated classic is a beautiful and whimsical tale of self-discovery, with an all-star voice cast including Angela Lansbury, Christopher Lee, and Mia Farrow. It's a timeless and charming film that will transport you to a world of wonder and magic.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more grounded in reality, I'd recommend \"The Secret of My Success\" (1987). This comedy stars Michael J. Fox as Arthur Tate, a young man who rises to fame and fortune with the help of three women and his clever schemes. It's a fun and lighthearted film that's sure to bring a smile to your face!",
