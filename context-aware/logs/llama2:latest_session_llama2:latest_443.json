Starring as the titular characters are James McAvoy and Brenda Blethyn. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more action-packed, \"Untraceable\" (2008) might be more up your alley. The film follows an FBI agent as she races against time to catch a serial killer who posts his victims' live videos online, starring Christopher Cousins and Jesse Tyler Ferguson.
