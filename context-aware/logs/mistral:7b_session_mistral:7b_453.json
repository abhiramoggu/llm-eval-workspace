It's an intense, thought-provoking film that's sure to keep you engaged.\n\nIf you fancy something a bit lighter, \"The Secret of My Success\" starring Michael J. Fox might be more up your alley. This comedy follows a young man rising through the ranks of corporate America in the 1980s, facing various challenges and romantic entanglements along the way. It's a fun, entertaining watch!",
