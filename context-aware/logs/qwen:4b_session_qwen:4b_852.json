The movie tells the story of how this young woman came to be where she is now, and what happened to her after that.\n- The Shadows (2015) starring: Adrienne King, Glenn Morshower): This movie is about an idyllic, small, self-sufficient community. On the surface, it seems like the perfect neighborhood. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. But the pastoral exterior conceals a dark past and an even darker secret. As a group of individuals  (each with their own ties and agendas with the town and each other) converge on the enclave, strange things begin to happen. Very strange things. Strange enough to test  (and then break) the very fabric of reality itself.\n- Psychic Experiment (N/ A) starring: Adrienne King, Glenn Morshower): This movie is about a seaman who lives for only one purpose: to redeem himself.",
