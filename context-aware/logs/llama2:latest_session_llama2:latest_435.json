The film features a talented cast, including Fanny Ardant and Eric Cantona, and offers a thought-provoking exploration of power and leadership.\n* \"The Equalizer\" (2014) - This action-thriller stars Denzel Washington as a private detective who works with criminals to fight against injustice. The movie delves into the moral ambiguity of his profession and features a gripping plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nBoth of these movies offer a similar blend of action, drama, and intrigue that I believe you'll find enjoyable based on your interest in \"Speed Racer\".",
