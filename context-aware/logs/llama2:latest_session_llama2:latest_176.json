The movie follows two detectives as they take on a powerful Russian crime boss with a unique way of eliminating those who stand in her way. If you're in the mood for something more lighthearted, \"Trees Lounge\" (1996) is a quirky and entertaining comedy-drama featuring Daniel Baldwin, Debi Mazar, and Steve Buscemi. The movie follows an unemployed mechanic who spends most of his time in a bar, struggling with his drinking habit and trying to find meaning in his life.
