The film features a talented young cast, including Mia Wasikowska and Hayley Atwell, and explores themes of identity, relationships, and self-discovery. It's a beautifully shot and poignant coming-of-age story that could resonate with you.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more laid-back and quirky, I'd suggest \"Trees Lounge\" (1996). This indie comedy-drama stars Steve Buscemi and features a talented ensemble cast, including Debi Mazar and Carol Kane. It's a charming and offbeat exploration of small-town life, relationships, and the search for meaning.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
