Strange enough to test  (and then break) the very fabric of reality itself.\n- Title: The Newton Boys (1998) | Plot: The story of the Newton gang, the most successful bank robbers in history, owing to their good planning and minimal violence.\n- Title: We the Living (1936) | Plot: A real-time account of the events on United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on September 11th, 2001 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot.\nThese movies are based on user preference cues such as genre, plot keywords, etc. The first movie is \"Psychic Experiment\" (N/ A), a historical drama film.
