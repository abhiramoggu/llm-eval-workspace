The film sheds light on the complexities and human cost of the conflict.\n\nFor a lighter and more comedic take on the Civil War, \"Hell's Angels\" (1930) starring Marian Marsh and Jean Harlow is a captivating and poignant film. It offers a glimpse into the lives of soldiers and the sacrifices they make.",
