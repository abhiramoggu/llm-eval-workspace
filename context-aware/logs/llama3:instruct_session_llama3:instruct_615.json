It's a hilarious comedy about a high school biology teacher who becomes a mixed martial arts fighter to save his school's extracurricular programs. With Jason Miller's charming performance as the lead, it's an entertaining ride from start to finish.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense and action-packed, I'd suggest \"Unleashed\" (2005). Jet Li stars as a former slave-turned-fighter who must use his skills to rescue himself and others from their brutal captors. With plenty of thrilling fight scenes and a gripping storyline, this one's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!",
