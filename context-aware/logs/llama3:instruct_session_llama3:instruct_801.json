This raunchy and hilarious film stars Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as two friends who switch bodies after a wild night. With its witty dialogue and outrageous situations, you'll be laughing out loud from start to finish!\n\nIf that's not your cup of tea, I'd also recommend The Hudsucker Proxy (1994). This quirky comedy features a talented cast, including Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Steve Buscemi. With its offbeat humor and absurd plot twists, it's the perfect choice for anyone looking for a light-hearted, entertaining romp.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
