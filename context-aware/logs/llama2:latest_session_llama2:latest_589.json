Alternatively, if you're interested in exploring themes of slavery and the supernatural, \"Beloved\" is a powerful and haunting film featuring Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover. Both are excellent choices, but I highly recommend \"Gone with the Wind\" for its sweeping romance and historical significance.",
