When he's finally released, he sets out on a quest for retribution against those responsible for his captivity.\n\nIf you'd like to explore more world cinema options, I can also recommend \"A Bittersweet Life\" (2005) by Kim Jee-woon, which is a dark and gritty tale of revenge and betrayal set in the world of organized crime.",
