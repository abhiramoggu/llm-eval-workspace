Plus, the cast featuring Taylor Cole is definitely worth checking out!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, I'd suggest \"Aladdin\". While it's a Disney classic, it does have some edgy moments and memorable characters that might make it enjoyable for you. Who knows, you might even find yourself singing along with the iconic soundtrack!\n\nLet me know if either of these spark your interest!",
