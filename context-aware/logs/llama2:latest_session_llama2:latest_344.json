Based on your preference for a 19th century movie, I highly recommend \"Black Beauty.\" The film is an classic adaptation of Anna Sewell's novel, following the journey of a young horse named Black Beauty and his experiences with various owners and situations in the late 19th century. The movie features an talented cast, including Sean Bean and Abbey Ryan, and is sure to captivate you with its heartwarming and thought-provoking story. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more modern take on a 19th century theme, \"Unstoppable\" is also worth checking out. This documentary explores the lives of five iconic women who challenged societal norms and made significant impacts in their respective fields, including sports, politics, and entertainment. Both movies offer unique perspectives on the 19th century and its legacy in contemporary society.",
