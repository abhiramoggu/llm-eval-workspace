      "text": "Based on your preferences, I would recommend \"Divergent\" by Amie Venzuela. This movie is about a young woman named Tris who discovers that she's Divergent, which means she can't control the thoughts and actions of those around her. As Tris begins to understand what it means to be Divergent, she also discovers that there are others like her throughout the world. Together, these \"like-minded individuals\" must band together in order to protect themselves from those who would seek to harm them. Overall, I believe that \"Divergent\" is a truly exceptional movie that I would highly recommend to anyone who has even remotely heard of it.",
