This animated comedy features a star-studded voice cast, including Will Smith and Robert De Niro, and has a great mix of humor and adventure. The plot is also quite clever, with a fish named Oscar who pretends to be a hero shark to impress his peers.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different, I'd recommend \"Afterlife\" (2011). This film takes a more emotional approach, exploring the relationship between a son and his father's ghost. It's a heartwarming story that might resonate with you if you enjoy films that focus on character development.",
