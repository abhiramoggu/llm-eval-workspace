It's a powerful drama that explores the complexities of war veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, and the investigator who is determined to uncover the truth behind his son's disappearance. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking story with a unique plot, \"The Way Back Home\" starring Danny Nucci and Ruby Dee might be up your alley. It's a moving drama that follows a man who returns to his hometown after his grandmother suffers a stroke, only to embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing.",
