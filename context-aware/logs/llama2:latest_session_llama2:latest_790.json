Both movies have a unique blend of sports and drama that should satisfy your craving for a great film. In \"Stormy Monday\", Tommy Lee Jones plays a crooked businessman who tries to push the owner of a nightclub in Newcastle, England to sell him the club, while in \"Gless\", Dustin Milligan stars as a hardened gunslinger who is repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to mount a showdown in a friendly town in Canada.",

If you enjoyed \"weird\" plots and football, then you might enjoy \"We Are Marshall.\" It's a powerful true story about the aftermath of a plane crash that claims the lives of members of a college football team, and how the surviving players come together to keep their program alive. Plus, it stars Matthew McConaughey in an early role, which I think you'll find interesting. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted but still with a football connection, \"Shrek 2\" is a hilarious animated adventure that follows Shrek and Fiona as they visit Fiona's parents in the Kingdom of Far Far Away. The movie features an all-star voice cast, including Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Cleese, among others. I hope you find something that interests you!",
