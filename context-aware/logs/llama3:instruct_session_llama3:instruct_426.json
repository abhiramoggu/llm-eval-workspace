With a talented cast, including Mia Wasikowska and Hayley Atwell, you'll be captivated by the characters' journeys.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something even more thought-provoking, I'd suggest \"Waiting\". This film delves into complex emotions and relationships, following Clare as she grapples with her decision to give up her baby. With a talented cast and a poignant storyline, \"Waiting\" will leave you reflecting on the complexities of human connection.\n\nLet me know if either of these resonate with you!",
