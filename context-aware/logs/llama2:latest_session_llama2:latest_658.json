If you're in the mood for a young-adult movie, I highly recommend \"The Man from Snowy River\" (1982) starring Tom Burlinson and Tony Bonner. This classic Australian film follows the story of a young man named Jim Craig as he navigates the challenges of growing up on a ranch in the 1880s. It's a heartwarming and adventurous tale that explores themes of self-discovery, friendship, and love.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more intense, \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) starring Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that explores the life of a troubled taxi driver in New York City. This movie is known for its gritty realism and powerful performances, making it a must-see for any movie enthusiast.",
