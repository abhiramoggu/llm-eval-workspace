The film is a classic underdog story about a small-time boxer who gets a chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world and finds love along the way. The movie has a great mix of drama, action, and humor, and its iconic training scene is sure to leave you motivated and inspired.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit different, I would suggest \"Trees Lounge\" (1996) starring Steve Buscemi and Carol Kane. This indie comedy follows the misadventures of a group of quirky characters who hang out at a dingy bar in a small town. With its offbeat humor and memorable characters, \"Trees Lounge\" is a great choice if you're looking for something a bit off the beaten path.",
