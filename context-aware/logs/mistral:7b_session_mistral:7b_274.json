It's a powerful exploration of human nature and morality through the lens of a courtroom drama.\n\nSecondly, \"The Illusionist\" (2006) is a visually stunning film that follows the journey of a magician seeking recognition in a changing world. Featuring an ensemble cast led by Edward Norton, this movie beautifully blends magic, romance, and intrigue to create an enchanting story.\n\nBoth films offer unique perspectives on performing arts, and I'm confident you'll enjoy either of them!",
