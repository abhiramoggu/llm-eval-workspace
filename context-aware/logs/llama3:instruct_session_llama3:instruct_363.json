The true story of John Nash's struggles with his mental health is both inspiring and deeply moving. Russell Crowe's performance as Nash is truly outstanding!\n\nIf you'd like to explore something more fast-paced and intriguing, I think \"Flatliners\" could be right up your alley! The premise of medical students exploring the afterlife through near-death experiences is a fascinating concept, and the cast includes some great actors like Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nWhat do you say?
