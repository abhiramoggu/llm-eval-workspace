The film explores complex themes like time travel and human connection, which are similar to the emotional depth found in Her.\n\nSecondly, Smokin' Aces is a fun and quirky movie that might surprise you. With an all-star cast featuring Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, and Jason Bateman, it's a wild ride filled with humor and action. While it's not directly related to love or relationships like Her, its fast-paced and entertaining plot could be a great match for your taste.\n\nLet me know if either of these movies piques your interest!",
