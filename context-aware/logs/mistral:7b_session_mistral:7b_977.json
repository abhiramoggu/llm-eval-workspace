This film follows a troubled teenager who starts seeing visions of a man in a rabbit suit manipulating him to commit crimes. With captivating performances by actors like Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for something truly unique and disturbing, 'House of 1000 Corpses' (2003) is a must-watch. Directed by Rob Zombie, this film tells the story of two young couples searching for urban legends of murder, only to become prisoners of a sadistic backwoods family of serial killers. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted!",
