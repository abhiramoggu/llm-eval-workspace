Alternatively, if you're looking for something with a bit more action and superpowers, \"X-Men: First Class\" (2011) could be up your alley.

It's a light-hearted and entertaining take on the \"stranger on a plane\" trope with plenty of humor and romance. Alternatively, if you're interested in something more classic and dramatic, I would suggest \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore as the adulterous Hester Prynne.
