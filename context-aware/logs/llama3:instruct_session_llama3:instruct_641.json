It's an action-packed classic starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a factory worker who discovers his memories are false and he's actually a spy! The film has a similar blend of adventure and intrigue that made RED so enjoyable.\n\nIf you're looking for something entirely different, I'd also recommend \"Mama\" (2013). This heartwarming documentary tells the inspiring true story of Kim Addison, a survivor of domestic violence who becomes an MMA trainer to help others overcome their own struggles. It's a powerful and uplifting film that explores themes of resilience and empowerment.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more recommendations!",
