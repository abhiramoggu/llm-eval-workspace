'Mama' - This film is about two sisters who are found alone in the woods after a chilling tragedy. They are adopted by their uncle and his girlfriend, but soon, strange events begin to unfold at their new home. The supernatural element in this movie might appeal to you if you enjoyed \"The Mummy Returns.\"\n\n2. 'Easy A' - While it doesn't feature monsters in the traditional sense, it does have a captivating plot about reputation and rumors similar to those found in \"The Mummy Returns\". Emma Stone delivers a brilliant performance as a high school student whose false claim of losing her virginity leads to an unexpected chain of events.",
