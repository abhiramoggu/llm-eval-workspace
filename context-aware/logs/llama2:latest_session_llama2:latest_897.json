The movie follows an engineer who discovers a hidden microchip in his body that contains information about a heist he didn't commit, leading him on a dangerous run from those who want the chip for their own nefarious purposes. It has plenty of action and intrigue to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAlternatively, \"Alex in Wonderland\" (N/A) might also be of interest, as it explores the inner workings of the movie industry through the eyes of a bohemian filmmaker. The movie is a surreal and imaginative exploration of the creative process and the challenges of balancing artistic expression with commercial success. It features a talented cast including Angelo Rossitto, Jeanne Moreau, Paul Mazursky, and Ellen Burstyn.",
