However, if we focus on that one, I'd highly recommend it! Seven Samurai (1954) is an epic samurai film directed by Akira Kurosawa. The story follows a group of farmers who hire seven ronin (masterless samurai) to protect their village from bandits. It's considered one of the greatest films ever made and offers a deep insight into Japanese culture and history. Enjoy the watch!",

This movie is set in Northern California but offers a unique blend of Japanese-inspired themes with its storyline about a gang from the 1950s descending upon a group of bikers. The film stars Taylor Cole, who you mentioned as an actor preference cue.\n\nIf you're open to venturing into a different time and setting, I'd also like to suggest \"Aladdin\" (1992). This animated classic has a wonderful mix of humor, musical numbers, and a heartwarming love story that will appeal to your taste for intriguing plots.
