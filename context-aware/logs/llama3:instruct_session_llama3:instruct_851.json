Alternatively, if you're looking for something more rooted in Indian society, \"Trees Lounge\" might be a great choice - it's a gritty drama that explores the lives of working-class people in small-town America, but has a similar tone and atmosphere to many Indian films.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
