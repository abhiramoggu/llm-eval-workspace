Denzel Washington is fantastic as the complex and troubled Detective Alonzo Harris, and the film has a real sense of tension and uncertainty throughout.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted, I'd also recommend \"It's a Wonderful Life\".

The film features some wonderful performances, including James Stewart as George Bailey, and has a real sense of nostalgia and charm to it.",
