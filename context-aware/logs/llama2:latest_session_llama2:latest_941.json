It's a fun and lighthearted watch with plenty of laughs and warm moments.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in something a bit more quirky and offbeat, then \"Alex in Wonderland\" might be the perfect choice for you. This movie stars Angelo Rossitto and Jeanne Moreau as a bohemian filmmaker who fantasizes about movie scenarios of his everyday situations, influenced by his movie idols.
