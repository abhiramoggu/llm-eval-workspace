Macy as a smooth-talking tobacco lobbyist trying to balance his professional and personal life. It's a hilarious ride with great performances and clever writing.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more lighthearted, I'd suggest \"The Nutty Professor\" (1996) - Eddie Murphy shines as a shy professor who discovers a magical potion that turns him into a charming ladies' man. It's a fun, over-the-top comedy with plenty of laughs.\n\nLet me know if you have any other preferences or if you'd like more recommendations!",
