I think you might really enjoy \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) - it's a classic film noir that sets the tone for the genre, with Orson Welles' iconic performance as a Mexican-American police captain who becomes embroiled in a complex web of murder, corruption, and deceit. The cinematography is also stunning, capturing the gritty atmosphere of a border town.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern, \"Bound\" (1996) could be up your alley - it's a stylish and suspenseful thriller that pays homage to the femme fatale trope, with strong performances from Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon as two women who team up to pull off a daring heist.",
