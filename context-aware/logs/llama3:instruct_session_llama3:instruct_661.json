Both films explore complex themes and moral dilemmas that might resonate with you. In \"Restless\", Mia Wasikowska shines alongside a talented cast, delving into the lives of individuals searching for meaning and connection. Meanwhile, \"You\" is a thought-provoking thriller that challenges our understanding of right and wrong in the face of societal pressures.\n\nWould either of these pique your interest?",
