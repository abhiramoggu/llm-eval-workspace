      "text": "Of course, I'd be happy to recommend some existentialism movies based on your preferences! \"Restless\" (2006) is a great choice if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and emotional drama. The film follows Ari, a man who is disconnected from the world around him until he meets Tiina, who challenges his perspective on life. It stars Mia Wasikowska, Hayley Atwell, Jane Adams, Rufus Sewell, and Charlotte Rampling. Alternatively, \"Elysium\" (2013) is another great option that explores the themes of inequality and the struggle for power. Set in a dystopian future, the film follows a man who takes on a mission to bring equality to the polarized worlds of the wealthy and the rest of society. It stars Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley, and Alice Braga. I hope you enjoy these recommendations!",

If you're interested in a classic existentialist film with a unique plot, I would suggest \"The Trouble with Harry\" starring Alfred Hitchcock and Jerry Mathers. This movie follows the story of a dead man whose body is found in the woods and the various reactions of the townspeople as they try to determine how and why he died. It's a thought-provoking and quirky film that I think you would enjoy.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a more recent movie with a similar existentialist tone, I recommend \"End of Watch\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and David Harbour. This film follows two young police officers as they patrol the streets of LA and encounter criminal forces greater than themselves. The documentary-style shooting adds to the gritty realism of the movie, making it a compelling watch.",
