The film stars John McMartin and Nancy Allen as a couple who become embroiled in a dangerous mystery when they stumble upon a car accident that may not have been an accident at all. On the other hand, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, \"Uptown Girls\" might be up your alley. The movie features Marley Shelton as a grown woman who acts like a child and ends up working as the nanny of an 8-year-old girl who surprisingly behaves like an adult. Both films have a great cast of actors and are definitely worth checking out!",
