Based on your user preference cues, I would recommend \"Taken\" and \"Her.\"\n\n\"Taken\" is a thrilling movie that combines elements of mystery, suspense, and action, which seems to align with your interest in psychiatry and the plot keywords you provided. The film's focus on kidnapping and the chase to rescue the friends adds an extra layer of excitement and tension. Starring Liam Neeson and Olivier Rabourdin, the movie features a strong cast that will keep you engaged.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Her\" is a more introspective and thought-provoking film that explores themes of love, relationships, and technology. With a unique blend of drama, romance, and science fiction, the movie offers a fresh perspective on modern dating experiences and the impact of technology on our lives. Scarlett Johansson's performance adds depth and emotion to the film, making it a must-see for anyone interested in exploring these themes further.",
