This powerful film tells the true story of the infamous Irish civil rights protest march and its tragic aftermath. The all-star cast, including James Nesbitt and Tim Pigott-Smith, brings this important moment in history to life with great emotional depth.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more lighthearted yet still thought-provoking option, \"When the Wind Blows\" (1998) might be just what you need. This quirky British film takes a unique look at how an elderly couple copes with the aftermath of a nuclear war - and it's surprisingly hilarious!",
