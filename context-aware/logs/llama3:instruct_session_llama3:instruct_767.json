It's a hilarious and thought-provoking ride with an all-star cast, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Salma Hayek. The plot is as wild as it is clever, following two renegade angels trying to exploit a loophole and reenter Heaven.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more grounded, I'd recommend \"The Wraith\" (1986). It's a cult classic that combines road racing with supernatural elements, featuring Randy Quaid and Clint Howard as a dynamic duo. The film has a great 80s vibe and is perfect for fans of \"Thelma & Louise\" or \"Easy Rider.\"",
