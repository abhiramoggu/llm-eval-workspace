On the other hand, if you're in the mood for a classic holiday tale with a heartwarming message, then \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is a timeless choice. This 1946 film stars James Stewart as a frustrated businessman who is shown what life would be like if he never existed, and it's sure to leave you feeling festive and fulfilled.",

The film features stunning footage and interviews with Petit himself, making it a captivating and thought-provoking watch.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a movie with a rich historical context and strong performances, I would recommend \"Utsav.\" Based on a 2nd century BCE Sanskrit play, the film follows the story of a courtesan who hides in a man's house while running away from the amorous attentions of the king's brother-in-law. The film features strong performances from Anupam Kher and Rekha, and offers a fascinating glimpse into Indian culture and history.",
