The movie features an all-star cast, including Eddie Griffin, Erik Per Sullivan, Jason Isaacs, Owen Wilson, Will Patton, and Bruce Willis. I think you'll find it to be a thoroughly enjoyable watch! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a more psychological and mysterious take on the mockumentary genre, then \"White Night\" (2007) might be more up your alley. The film follows an inspector as he re-investigates a long-forgotten murder case that he couldn't solve years ago, and it uncovers some surprising and dark secrets along the way. The movie features a talented cast, including 3 actors who have worked together before in \"The Secret of My Success\" (N/A). Let me know if you're interested in either of these movies, and I'd be happy to provide more information! \ud83d\ude0a",
