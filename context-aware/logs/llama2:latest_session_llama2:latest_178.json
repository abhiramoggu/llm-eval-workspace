This classic novel adaptation follows a Lady who is suspected of killing a blackmailing lawyer who learned of her child by an earlier marriage to a criminal. The film features an all-star cast and is sure to satisfy your romantic cravings. Alternatively, if you're looking for something more modern, I would suggest \"The Governess\" starring Minnie Driver. This sensuous romance follows a governess who is hired into a remote Scottish household and strongly affects all those she comes into contact with. Both of these movies promise to deliver on their erotic romance elements while also offering engaging plots and talented acting performances.",
