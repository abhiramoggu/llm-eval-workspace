Directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, this sci-fi masterpiece explores themes of humanity, artificial intelligence, and what it means to be alive. The atmospheric visuals and philosophical questions will keep you engaged till the very end!\n\nOr, if you'd prefer a more contemporary take on dystopia, \"You\" (2014) is another great option. This psychological thriller delves into the consequences of gun violence and explores the moral gray areas in a society where right and wrong are no longer clear-cut.\n\nLet me know which one piques your interest!",
