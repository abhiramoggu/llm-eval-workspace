The plot is eerie and suspenseful, with a possessed young girl and two priests trying to save her. You might also enjoy \"When a Stranger Calls\" (2006), which has a similar sense of tension and unease as it follows a babysitter being terrorized by a mysterious caller.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more campy and over-the-top, then \"House of 1000 Corpses\" (2003) might be the way to go. It's a wild ride full of gore, blood, and Rob Zombie's signature style.",
