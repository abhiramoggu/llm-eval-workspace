This movie is set in a dystopian society where factions are divided by virtues, and the protagonist discovers she's Divergent, which makes her a threat to the ruling powers. The action scenes are intense and the plot keeps you guessing until the very end.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more retro and campy, \"The Wraith\" (1986) starring Randy Quaid and Clint Howard might be up your alley. This movie follows a group of teenagers who get targeted by a mysterious figure in a sleek black car, leading to a series of hilarious and memorable moments. The film has a distinct 80s vibe that fans of classic sci-fi movies will appreciate.",
