It's a powerful documentary that sheds light on the environmental and social issues in China, featuring real-life stories of those affected by pollution. The film is both thought-provoking and eye-opening, and I think it would be a great choice if you're looking to learn more about China.\n\nIf documentaries aren't your cup of tea, \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" could be an exciting option! This James Bond movie features Pierce Brosnan as the iconic spy, and its plot revolves around a villainous media mogul trying to start a war between China and the UK. The film has plenty of action-packed sequences and clever gadgets to keep you entertained.\n\nLet me know if either of these pique your interest, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
