If you're in the mood for a mystery-thriller with a twisty plot and strong performances, then \"White Night\" might be the perfect choice for you.

Alternatively, if you're interested in exploring themes of identity and ancestry, then \"The Tree of Life\" could be a great choice. This film follows a woman from Los Angeles as she travels to Italy to trace the roots of her Italian Jewish ancestors, and features powerful performances from its cast, including Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt.",
