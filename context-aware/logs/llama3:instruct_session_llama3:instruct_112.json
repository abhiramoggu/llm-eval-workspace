If you're in the mood for a classic horror movie that's still highly effective today, I'd recommend \"The Conjuring\" (2013) - it's based on a true story and features a great performance from Vera Farmiga as a paranormal investigator. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more modern and critically acclaimed, I think you might enjoy \"Get Out\" (2017), which is a clever blend of horror and social commentary that won several Academy Awards.",
