The film features a talented cast, including Jessica Chastain and Mark Duplass, and is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, known for her visceral and thought-provoking films. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more unique and atmospheric take on the war genre, \"The Forest of Hands and Teeth\" might be up your alley.
