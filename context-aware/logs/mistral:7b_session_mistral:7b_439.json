In the movie, she curses an infant princess but finds a connection with her that could change their troubled land. Another great choice is \"The Gambler\" (2014), starring Michael Caine and Mark Wahlberg, which follows a literature professor and gambler who risks his life for a second chance while dealing with complicated relationships and mounting debts.
