It's a fun, light-hearted rom-com that takes place in the summer of 1962 in Hollywood, but it also pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock, who was known for his work with Massachusetts-based film studios. And let me tell you, the cast is fantastic - Will Smith and Eva Mendes are great together!\n\nIf you're not in the mood for a rom-com, \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979) might be up your alley! It's a thought-provoking drama that explores themes of morality, politics, and relationships, all set against the backdrop of Massachusetts.",
