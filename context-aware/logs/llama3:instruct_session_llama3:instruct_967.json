This mockumentary-style film is all about exploring the legend of the Loch Ness monster, featuring some great cameos from Werner Herzog and Ricky Jay. It's a lighthearted, entertaining watch that might just surprise you!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense and thrilling, I'd suggest \"Final Destination\" (2000).

You'll be on the edge of your seat as the characters try to cheat death!\n\nWhich one of these catches your eye?",
