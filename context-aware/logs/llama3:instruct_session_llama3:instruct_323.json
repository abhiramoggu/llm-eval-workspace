Plus, who wouldn't want to see a gentle giant defend his loved one against all odds?\n\nOr, if you're up for something more magical, \"Maleficent\" (2014) might just fit the bill!

This drama is based on real events and features a talented cast, including Tim Pigott-Smith and James Nesbitt. It's a powerful portrayal of a pivotal moment in history that will likely leave you emotionally impacted.\n\nAlternatively, if you're up for something more action-packed and with a dash of humor, \"Lord of War\" (2005) might be right up your alley. With Nicolas Cage starring as an arms dealer on the run from INTERPOL, this film offers plenty of thrills and twists to keep you engaged.\n\nWhich one piques your interest?",
