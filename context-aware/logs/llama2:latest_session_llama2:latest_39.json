The film follows an accidental discovery that unearths painful memories from eight years ago, and things take a turn for the unexpected. It's a gripping and emotional ride with great actors bringing depth to their characters. Another recommendation would be \"The Devil's Rejects\" starring Jossara Jinaro, Matthew McGrory, Steve Railsback, and Lew Temple. This movie is a wild ride with a murderous family on the run from a ruthless sheriff. It has great performances and some truly gruesome moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
