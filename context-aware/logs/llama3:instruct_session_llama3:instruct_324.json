This quirky horror-comedy stars Michael Parks as a mysterious recluse with a rather... interesting hobby. It's a wild ride that's sure to leave you laughing and cringing in equal measure!",

Instead, I'd suggest checking out \"Eve's Bayou\", which has some great elements of mystery and suspense, and even features some voodoo magic! It's a unique blend of drama, romance, and supernatural flair that might just capture your attention.\n\nIf you're open to something completely different, \"Training Day\" is an intense crime thriller with Denzel Washington in a phenomenal performance.
