Since you mentioned Aladdin and were expecting a different vibe, I'm going to suggest two movies that might surprise you in a good way.\n\nFirstly, Moulin Rouge! is a visually stunning musical romp set in 1890s Paris. With an all-star cast, including Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, it's a whirlwind of music, drama, and romance that will keep you enthralled. And who knows, you might just find yourself swept up in the dance numbers!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern and action-packed, The Equalizer is a great choice. With Denzel Washington leading the cast as a former Black Ops operative turned private detective, it's an intense thriller that explores themes of justice and morality. Plus, with Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Marton Csokas in supporting roles, there's plenty to keep you engaged!",

As you might expect from Paul McCartney's concert film, it's a lively and energetic performance with some truly iconic songs. Even if you're not a huge fan of Wings, the restored sound and visuals make this a must-see for any music lover.",
