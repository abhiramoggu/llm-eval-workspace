If you're looking for a similar movie that might resonate with you, I would recommend \"The Social Network\". It's a well-crafted and engaging biopic that tells the story of the founding of Facebook and the challenges faced by its founder Mark Zuckerberg, with a similar blend of tech and drama. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more historical biopic, \"Lincoln\" is an excellent film that delves into the life of one of America's most iconic presidents and his quest to pass the 13th Amendment. Both movies are highly rated and have received critical acclaim, so I hope you find one that suits your interests!",
