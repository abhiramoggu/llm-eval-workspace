As a computer animation fan, you might appreciate the blend of virtual reality and detective work in this 1999 film. The all-star cast adds to its appeal, with talented actors like Shiri Appleby and Gretchen Mol bringing the characters to life.\n\nLet me know if either of these pique your interest!",
