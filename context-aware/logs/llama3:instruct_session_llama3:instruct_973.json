The film follows Smilla, a half-Inuit detective, as she uncovers the truth behind a young boy's death in Copenhagen.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more introspective and character-driven, I think \"The Yearling\" (1930) would be an excellent choice. This classic drama is set in rural Florida during the early 20th century and explores themes of love, loss, and growing up through the eyes of a young boy who adopts a deer.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information or recommendations!",
