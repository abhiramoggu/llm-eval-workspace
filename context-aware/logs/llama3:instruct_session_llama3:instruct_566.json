This powerful German drama tells the story of Adolf Hitler's final days during World War II, starring Bruno Ganz as the infamous leader. It's a gripping and emotional ride that explores the complexities of leadership and morality.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern and suspenseful, I'd recommend \"Shattered\" (1973). This classic thriller follows two detectives as they take on a ruthless crime boss, with a surprising twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat. With an all-star cast including Corbin Bernsen and Tom Berenger, this movie is sure to satisfy your reboot cravings!",
