If you're in the mood for a police procedural movie, I highly recommend \"Pineapple Express.\" It's a hilarious and action-packed film featuring an all-star cast, including Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Danny McBride. The plot follows a process server and his marijuana dealer as they go on the run from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after witnessing a murder. \ud83c\udfac\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more serious, \"World Trade Center\" is a powerful and emotional drama that tells the true story of two Port Authority police officers who became trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks. It's a moving and thought-provoking film that will leave you feeling inspired and grateful for the bravery of these heroes. \ud83d\udcaa",
