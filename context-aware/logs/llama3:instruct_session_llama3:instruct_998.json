This sci-fi romance explores the complexities of a woman's love and her decision to bear the clone of her dead beloved. The film features Eva Green, known for her roles in \"Penny Dreadful\" and \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\". It's a thought-provoking and emotionally charged movie that might surprise you with its unique premise.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more light-hearted and romantic, I recommend \"Dear John\" (2010). This film stars Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried in a love story about two young people who fall in love despite the challenges they face. The movie has a strong focus on the emotional ups and downs of relationships, making it a great fit for those who enjoy romance.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
