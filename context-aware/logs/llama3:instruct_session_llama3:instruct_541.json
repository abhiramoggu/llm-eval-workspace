Or if you're in the mood for something more grounded in reality, \"Jack Reacher\" is a great choice, starring Tom Cruise as the titular investigator - it's a tense and suspenseful ride that'll keep you on the edge of your seat!",

With its military branch vibe and intense fight scenes, I think it's a great fit for someone who likes the sound of Jack Reacher.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit different, \"Easy A\" is also a fun choice! It's a witty and charming teen comedy that explores themes of identity and reputation. With Emma Stone shining as the lead, this movie has a lot to offer if you're looking for a lighthearted and entertaining watch.",
