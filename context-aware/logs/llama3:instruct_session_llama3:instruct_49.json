It's an action-packed thriller starring Tom Cruise as a former military sniper who must clear his name after being accused of a mass shooting. The plot is gripping, and Tom Cruise brings his signature intensity to the role.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit different, I'd also recommend \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979). While not primarily a military movie, it features Alan Alda as a senator who must navigate the complexities of politics, which might appeal to your interest in the military branch. The film has a great cast and explores themes of personal and professional integrity.\n\nWhich one piques your interest?",

Bradley Cooper stars alongside an impressive ensemble cast, making it a compelling watch.\n\nLet me know if either piques your interest!",
