It sounds like you enjoy movies with a mix of genres and plots that are both thought-provoking and visually appealing.

The all-star cast, including Seth Meyers, Chris Klein, and Dennis Quaid, brings the story to life with their excellent performances. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat and quirky, \"Restless\" is definitely worth checking out. It's a unique blend of coming-of-age and fantasy elements that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Both of these movies are sure to provide a great movie experience!",
