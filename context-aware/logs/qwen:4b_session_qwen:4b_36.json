Schindler's List (1993) directed by Steven Spielberg, is a drama film based on the book of the same name by Ben Kripke and Thomas Harris.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who during World War II uses his factory to manufacture arms for the Nazi regime.\n\nAs the war progresses, Schindler becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his employees and their families.\n\nIn an effort to save them from certain death at the hands of the Nazi soldiers, Schindler uses his factory to manufacture arms for the Nazi regime.\n\nAs a result of Schindler's actions, many of his employees and their families are saved from certain death at the hands of the Nazi soldiers, and some of them even go on to become successful professionals in their respective fields.\n\n2. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) directed by James Clavell, is a drama film based on the book of the same name by Eric A. Neufeld.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Johnnie (played by David Naaman)), an English soldier who during World War II is captured by the Japanese army and forced to work as a laborer in one of the Japanese prison camps, which are known for their harsh conditions and brutal treatment of the prisoners by the Japanese guards.\n\nAs time passes, Johnnie begins to experience feelings of resentment and anger towards the Japanese soldiers who he believes have wronged him and his fellow prisoners in some way or another, although he is not entirely sure about what exactly has caused him to develop such feelings.\n\nJohnnie eventually decides that he no longer wishes to remain a prisoner in one of the Japanese prison camps. Therefore, Johnnie begins to work on a scheme by which he believes he might be able to escape from one of the Japanese prison camps and make his way back to England, although he is not entirely sure about how exactly he might be able to carry out such a scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, as time passes, Johnnie also begins to develop feelings of resentment and anger towards the Japanese soldiers who he believes have wronged him and his fellow prisoners in some way or another, although he is not entirely sure about what exactly has caused him to develop such feelings.\n\nJohnnie eventually decides that he no longer wishes to remain a prisoner in one of the Japanese prison camps.
