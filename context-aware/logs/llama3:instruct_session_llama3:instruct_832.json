This epic drama stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, and its storyline is set against the backdrop of 19th-century New York City. The movie's themes of revenge, loyalty, and redemption are sure to keep you engaged.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a more modern take on the drama genre, I'd suggest \"The Town\" (2010). This crime drama stars Ben Affleck and features a strong supporting cast, including Jeremy Renner and Rebecca Hall. The movie's blend of action, romance, and suspense is sure to keep you entertained.\n\nLet me know if either of these options interest you, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
