Based on your interest in crime movies, I think you might enjoy \"Goodfellas\" (1990) - it's a classic mob drama that's both gripping and intense, with outstanding performances from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. If you're looking for something more modern, I'd recommend \"Sicario\" (2015) - it's a tense and thought-provoking thriller that explores the dark side of border politics, with exceptional performances from Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin.",
