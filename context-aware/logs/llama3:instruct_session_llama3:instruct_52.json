It's a horror-comedy that features a star-studded cast, including Rose McGowan and Bruce Willis. The movie takes place during a zombie outbreak and follows a group of survivors as they try to make it out alive.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",

With Scarlett Johansson's captivating voice as the AI operating system, this movie will keep you engaged and thinking long after the credits roll.\n\n\"The Odyssey\", on the other hand, is an epic adventure that spans centuries, with 24 short films woven together to tell Homer's timeless tale.
