This classic adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's novel explores themes of morality and redemption through Hazel Motes' journey to open a non-Christian church. The cinematography is also stunning, with some beautiful shots of the Southern landscape.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more suspenseful, \"Without Remorse\" (1993) might be right up your alley. This action-packed film stars Michael Biehn as an elite Navy SEAL seeking revenge for his wife's murder. With plenty of twists and turns, it's a thrilling ride that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
