I think I have just the right recommendations for you.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and visually stunning film, I'd highly recommend \"The Red Tent\" (1997). Based on Anita Diamant's novel, this movie takes you on a journey through the lives of four sisters in ancient Mesopotamia, exploring themes of identity, family, and love. The lush scenery and strong performances make it a captivating watch.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more contemporary, \"Afterlife\" (2011) might be up your alley. This critically acclaimed film explores the complexities of human relationships through the lens of a son's grief and his father's afterlife. With its poignant script and outstanding performances from John Simm and Peter Wight, this movie will leave you pondering the meaning of life.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
