It's a beautiful coming-of-age story about four sisters growing up during post-Civil War America, with wonderful performances from its all-female cast. The themes of sisterhood, love, and self-discovery will surely resonate with you!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more contemporary, \"The Shadows\" (2015) is a great option. It's a thrilling tale of a writer who gets entangled in a web of danger and deception after hitting a young man while driving. With its unique blend of mystery, suspense, and romance, this movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!",
