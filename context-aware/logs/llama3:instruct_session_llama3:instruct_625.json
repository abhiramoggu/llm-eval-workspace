It's a historical drama that delves into the life of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who played a crucial role in cracking the German Enigma code. Benedict Cumberbatch brings Turing to life with his captivating performance.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if one of these resonates with you!",
