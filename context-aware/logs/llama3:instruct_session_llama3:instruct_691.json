This adaptation of Jane Austen's novel stars Frances O'Connor and is a beautifully shot period drama that follows Fanny Price as she navigates her way through high society. With its themes of self-discovery and growth, it's a great fit for your request.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more modern, \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979) could be an interesting choice. This drama stars Melvyn Douglas, Alan Alda, and Meryl Streep, and follows the story of a senator who must balance his career with his personal life as he prepares to take on a new role. With its focus on character development and growth, it's another great example of a bildungsroman.",
