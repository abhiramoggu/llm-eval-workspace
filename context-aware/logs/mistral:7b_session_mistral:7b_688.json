Two films from this list that I'd recommend are \"Thelma & Louise\" and \"The Hours\".\n\nIn \"Thelma & Louise,\" two friends embark on an adventure that takes a turn when they find themselves on the run from the law, portraying a compelling narrative about female friendship and empowerment. Starring Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, and Brad Pitt, it's a captivating watch.\n\n\"The Hours,\" on the other hand, explores the lives of three women connected through Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway, delving into themes of suicide, love, and female identity. With an impressive ensemble cast featuring Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman, it's a thought-provoking cinematic experience that I believe you might enjoy.",
