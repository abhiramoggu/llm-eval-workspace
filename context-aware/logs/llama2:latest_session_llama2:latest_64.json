If you enjoy deeper plots and are interested in a mix of comedy and suspense, then \"The Relic\" might be the perfect choice for you.

On the other hand, if you're looking for something more lighthearted and entertaining, \"Uptown Girls\" might be up your alley. This 2007 film stars Marley Shelton as a grown-up woman who keeps her childish instincts and behavior, but things take an unexpected turn when she becomes the nanny of an 8-year-old girl who acts like an adult.
