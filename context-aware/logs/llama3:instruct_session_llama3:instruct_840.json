This one's a bit more unconventional, but in a good way! It's a wild ride with Colin Farrell as a screenwriter who gets caught up in the crazy world of LA gangsters. The film has a great balance of humor and action, making it an entertaining watch.\n\nAs for \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006) and \"Afterlife\" (2011), they're both amazing films in their own right, but I think they might not fit as well with your initial request to explore stories about rocked.
