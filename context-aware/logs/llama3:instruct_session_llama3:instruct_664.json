Alternatively, if you're open to something a bit more unconventional, \"Redline\" (2009) is an anime feature that takes the auto racing genre to new heights - literally!",

It's an intriguing indie film that takes you on a wild ride through an urban forest, exploring what it means to be a monster. The unscripted story and enthusiastic showrunner monster boy, Max, will keep you engaged and curious.\n\nLet me know if either of these options strike your fancy!",
