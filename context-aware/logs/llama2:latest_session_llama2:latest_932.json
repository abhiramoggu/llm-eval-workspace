If you're in the mood for a classic costume drama with a supernatural twist, I highly recommend \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" starring Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a more contemporary take on the police procedural genre with a strong cast, I suggest \"End of Watch\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a. The film follows two young detectives as they navigate the dangerous streets of LA and confront the harsh realities of their job.",
