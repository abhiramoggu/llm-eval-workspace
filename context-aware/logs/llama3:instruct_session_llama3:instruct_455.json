This one stars Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, and it's about a man who gets sent to anger management therapy after he loses his temper and gets arrested. It's a hilarious take on the ups and downs of life, and both leads bring their signature comedic styles to the film.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat, \"Louie\" might be up your alley! This 2000 TV movie follows Louie Evans, a quirky character who rides around Boston on his tricycle and becomes a local legend. It's a heartwarming and humorous exploration of what makes someone special.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
