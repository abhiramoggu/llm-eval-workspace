It's a classic crime drama that explores the world of organized crime through the eyes of Henry Hill, and it's a must-see for any fan of the genre. If you enjoy that one, I'd also recommend \"The Departed\" (2006), another Scorsese film that delves into the gritty world of undercover police work in Boston.",
