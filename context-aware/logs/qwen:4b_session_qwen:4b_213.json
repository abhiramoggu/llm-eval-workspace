It is a drama centered on the efforts of John and Aileen Crowley to find a researcher who might have a cure for their two children's rare genetic disorder.\n\nAnother recommendation could be \"Vampyres\". It is a deep in the rural English countryside, two tempting daughters of Erebus, the woeful wraith-like phantoms Fran and Miriam, prey on the innocent and the foolishly brave to tread alone.\n\n\"Black Swan\" is another\u63a8\u8350. This is a drama centered on the efforts of Detective Sam Baker to solve a horrific murder, but ends up being involved as a prime suspect.\n\nLastly, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" could be a good recommendation too.",
