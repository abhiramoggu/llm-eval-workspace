Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and starring Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, this German drama is an unflinching portrayal of the last days of the Third Reich. The film's raw intensity and powerful performances will leave you thinking long after the credits roll.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more modern and thought-provoking, \"The Social Network\" (2010) might be up your alley! Directed by David Fincher and starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, this film offers a fascinating commentary on the impact of social media on our lives. With its witty dialogue and clever score, it's an entertaining ride that will leave you pondering the consequences of our online actions.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
