I'd recommend starting with Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" - it's a thought-provoking exploration of wormhole travel and the search for a new home for humanity, featuring stunning visuals and a talented cast. If you enjoy that, you might also appreciate Denis Villeneuve's \"Arrival\", which delves into the mysteries of communication with extraterrestrial lifeforms through a complex and emotional journey.",
