Based on your preference for a movie with a similar theme, I highly recommend \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (1964) starring Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, and George C. Scott. This classic satirical comedy-drama is a masterpiece of cold war era filmmaking, with a hilarious and thought-provoking plot that explores the absurdity of nuclear warfare. Another great option is \"You\" (2014) starring AJ Cross, which is a tense and psychological thriller that delves into the mind of a lone spy trying to prevent a global catastrophe. Both of these movies are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!",
