This historical drama takes place in the 1870s and explores themes of family, love, and resilience as a father and son navigate the challenges of the American West. The film features a talented cast, including John Evans' stirring performance.\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I'd recommend \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1973), which stars Meryl Streep in an early role. This drama explores the complexities of politics and personal relationships as a liberal senator navigates the challenges of his career while trying to balance his family life.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
