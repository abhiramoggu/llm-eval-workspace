With an amazing cast of characters, including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, this film is sure to tickle your funny bone!\n\nIf you're not in the mood for something as absurdly hilarious, I could also recommend \"The Trouble with Harry\". It's a 1950s classic that explores what happens when a small town discovers a dead body in the woods, and everyone starts scrambling to figure out what happened.
