This one's got a unique premise - a traveling salesman gets to see visions of the future through illustrations on a mysterious man's body. It's a thought-provoking and eerie film that explores themes of technology and humanity.\n\nIf you're looking for something more modern, I suggest \"The Abyss\" (1989), directed by James Cameron. This sci-fi thriller takes place in a high-stakes environment where a team of deep-sea explorers must navigate an underwater catastrophe while uncovering secrets about the human condition. The film features stunning visual effects and a talented cast.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
