With a star-studded cast including Ryan McDonald and Oliver Platt, this film takes you on a heart-pumping adventure as a writer struggles to keep his family alive amidst a series of global catastrophes.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense and psychological, \"The Shadows\" (2015) is another great option. This movie follows a novelist whose dark past collides with his present when he hits a young man on the road, leading to a sinister plot that could be straight out of one of his own novels.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",

Plus, it's not too intense or scary, so it might be a good choice if you're looking for something more light-hearted.\n\nIf you'd rather watch something with a bit more action, \"This Means War\" is an action-packed romantic comedy that features Chris Pine and Tom Hardy as rival spies vying for the affections of Reese Witherspoon. It's got plenty of laughs, excitement, and heart, so it might be up your alley!",
