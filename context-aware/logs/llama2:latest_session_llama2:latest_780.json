This movie follows a former CIA agent who enlists the help of a young psychic to rescue his telekinetic son from a secret government agency. The film features a gripping plot with plenty of twists and turns, and the talented cast adds to the overall tense atmosphere.\n\nAnother great option is \"The Return of the Living Dead\" (1985) starring Thom Mathews and Linnea Quigley. This cult classic follows two bumbling employees who accidentally release a deadly gas into the air, causing the dead to rise as zombies. The film has a great mix of humor and horror, making it a fun and entertaining watch.",
