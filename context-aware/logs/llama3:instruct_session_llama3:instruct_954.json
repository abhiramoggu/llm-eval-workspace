It's a classic Shakespearean comedy that explores themes of ethics and relationships in a way that's both humorous and thought-provoking.

This 90s thriller explores some really interesting ethical questions about the afterlife and what lies beyond our physical existence. With a talented cast that includes Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon, it's a gripping and suspenseful ride from start to finish.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if one of these movies catches your eye!",
