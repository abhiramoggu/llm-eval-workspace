This classic film is a powerful exploration of the human psyche, starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. It's a timeless tale of rebellion and self-discovery that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more recent, I'd suggest \"The Whistler\" (2016). While it may not be directly related to psychiatry, its themes of trauma, mental toughness, and the human capacity for resilience are all deeply rooted in the psyche.",

It's also a great story about overcoming challenges and pushing boundaries, just like the characters in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\".\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for something a bit more light-hearted and humorous, \"The Other Guys\" is a fun and action-packed buddy cop comedy that shares some of the same themes of underdogs trying to make a name for themselves.",
