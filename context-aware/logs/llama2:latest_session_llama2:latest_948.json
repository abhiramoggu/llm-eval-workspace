The movie follows two detectives as they take on a Russian crime boss with the police department on her payroll, while also uncovering a secret that could put them in grave danger. The film has an exciting plot with plenty of twists and turns, and the actors deliver great performances. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted and fun, I would suggest \"Restless\" (2006) starring Mia Wasikowska and Hayley Atwell. The movie follows a group of friends as they spend their last summer of freedom together, and it has a great mix of humor and drama that should keep you entertained.",
