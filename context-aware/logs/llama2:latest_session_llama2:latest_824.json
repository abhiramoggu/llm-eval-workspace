The plot follows a high school senior who has a one-night stand with unexpected consequences.\n* \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) is a classic crime drama with an all-star cast, including Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro, and Gabriel Byrne. The movie follows the story of how a notorious criminal influenced events that began with five criminals meeting in a seemingly random police lineup.\n\nBoth movies are well-regarded for their engaging plots and talented casts, and I think you'll find them enjoyable if you liked \"Dancer in the Dark.\"",
