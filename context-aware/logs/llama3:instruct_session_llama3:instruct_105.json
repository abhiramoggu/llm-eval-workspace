Fox as Arthur Tate, who rises through the ranks with the help of three influential women. The movie has a lighthearted tone and explores themes of ambition, relationships, and personal growth.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more thought-provoking, \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" might be up your alley. This 1979 film stars Melvyn Douglas as a liberal senator struggling to balance his career with his personal life, all while developing feelings for a researcher (played by Meryl Streep). It's a great exploration of the complexities of relationships and the compromises we make in our pursuit of success.",
