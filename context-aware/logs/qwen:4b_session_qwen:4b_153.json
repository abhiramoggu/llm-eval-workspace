Kim' s personal mission is to empower, inspire and train women and children so they too can stand up for themselves against bullying. Among her students is 13- year- old Logan Chauvin. Logan was terrorized daily in school by callous bullies. He has been training vigorously with Kim to overcome his experience and is now getting ready for his first real MMA fight. Although Kim has done everything in her power to train Logan to stand up to bullies at school, there is very little she can do to protect him from his first real MMA opponent.",
