Starring the iconic Robin Williams, this film is a beautiful exploration of the power of poetry to inspire and connect people. With its themes of self-expression and understanding, it's a movie that will linger with you long after the credits roll.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more contemporary and thought-provoking, \"Elysium\" (2013) might be the way to go! This sci-fi thriller stars Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley, and while it's not strictly a poetry movie, its exploration of social justice and human connection is sure to resonate with fans of poetic themes.",
