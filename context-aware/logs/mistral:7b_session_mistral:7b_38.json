Hayden Christensen stars in this movie, which seems to have elements similar to 'The Equalizer'.\n\n2. \"Get Smart\" (2008) - This film features Maxwell Smart, a highly intelligent but bumbling spy working for the CONTROL agency, as he tries to prevent a terrorist attack from rival spy agency KAOS. Starring Dwayne Johnson and Anne Hathaway, it might offer a lighter, more comedic take on the action genre.\n\nBoth movies combine action and intrigue while featuring notable actors that you may enjoy!",
