But at night, it is the older Jack with whom Brooke fantasizes about sleeping. Even more so, the following day it is Jill who takes Brooke to a spa' s hot tub and hits on her with success. Rick and Mark show up afterward. Brooke seems to like Rick, so Mark heads back in defeat to his mother Billie. His overbearing mother takes advantage of his feelings of defeat with women to sleep with him herself. After Rick' s Latin maid teases his sexual inexperience, Rick reveals his suspicion about her having an affair with his father. Nevertheless, he says he likes her and also respects their privacy, so he wouldn' t tell her off to his mother. This makes the Latin maid change her mind about his maturity and she sleeps with him too. Later on, he gets more intimate with Brooke and she decides to sleep with him as well. He then comes clean about the plan to marry her. Brooke immediately dumps him and leaves NYC in her limo. She has the driver stop spontaneously for a hitchhiker, who is amazed when she pulls down his pants and lets him find himself on the receiving end unceremoniously.\nHere are some potential recommendations based on your preferences:\n\n- Title: Maid in Manhattan (2002)) | Plot: Frustrated that her acting career is not as challenging as her college years, Brooke Fields (portraying herself) takes a break from Hollywood by staying with distant family friends in New York City.
