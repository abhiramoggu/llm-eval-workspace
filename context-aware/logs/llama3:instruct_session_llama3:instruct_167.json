If you're in the mood for a Peter Parker movie, I think you might enjoy \"Spider-Man\" (not included in this list, but I can recommend some Spider-Man movies if you'd like!). However, since we're working with what we have, I'd suggest either \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" or \"I Love You, Man\". Both are hilarious comedies that feature a Peter-like main character and have great casts. If you're in the mood for some laughs and a fun story, one of these might be just what you need!",
