You'll be captivated by her poignant performance as she navigates the afterlife while watching over her loved ones.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more unconventional and quirky, \"Hesher\" might be just what you need. This offbeat comedy-drama features Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a memorable role as Hesher, a mischievous and eccentric character who shakes things up in the life of a grieving young boy.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
