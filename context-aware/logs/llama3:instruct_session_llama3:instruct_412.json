It's an action-packed thriller starring Denzel Washington, which seems quite different from the atmospheric and intense mood of Wuthering Heights. The plot explores justice and morality, which might interest you if you're looking for a more contemporary take on those themes.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like something a bit lighter, \"Dear John\" (2010) could be an option. It's a romantic comedy with a dash of drama, starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. While it doesn't directly relate to the plot keywords \"what\" and \"heights\", its lighthearted tone might be a refreshing change from the intense emotions in Wuthering Heights.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
