Although not entirely in Spanish, this intense action-thriller starring Denzel Washington has some amazing scenes shot in Mexico and features a strong performance from its lead actor. The plot is gripping, and the themes of redemption and sacrifice make it a compelling watch.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring more Spanish-language films, I could also recommend \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), which while not exclusively in Spanish, has some beautiful scenes featuring Latin American culture and music. Robert De Niro's iconic performance as Travis Bickle is unforgettable!\n\nWhich one piques your interest?",
