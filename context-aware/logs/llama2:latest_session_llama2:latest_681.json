The action-packed plot and talented cast make for an exciting and entertaining movie. Alternatively, \"Restless\" could also be a great pick, as it follows a character named Ari who doesn't do relationships or attachments until he meets Tiina, and together they embark on a summer of adventure and self-discovery.
