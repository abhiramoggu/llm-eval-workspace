This historical drama stars Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I, and it's a beautifully crafted film that explores her early years as monarch. You'll get to see Cate bring this iconic figure to life in a truly captivating way.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different, I also think \"The Shadows\" (2015) could be up your alley. While not strictly about monarchs, the plot does involve a complex web of relationships and power struggles, which might appeal to your interest in monarchies. Plus, the film features some great performances from its cast!",
