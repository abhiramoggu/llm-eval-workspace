It's an epic adventure set in the 12th century, with a stellar cast including Liam Neeson and Orlando Bloom. The film follows Balian as he defends Jerusalem during the Crusades, and it's a real thrill ride.\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I also recommend \"Little Women\". While it may not be as action-packed, it's a beautiful period drama that explores the lives of four sisters coming of age in post-Civil War America. The film is a wonderful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel.",
