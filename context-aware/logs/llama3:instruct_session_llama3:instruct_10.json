I think \"Schindler's List\" is an excellent starting point - it's a powerful and emotional portrayal of one of the darkest moments in human history, and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is simply stunning. If you're interested in something a bit more action-packed, \"Gladiator\" is also an incredible film that explores the complexities of ancient Rome through stunning visuals and a gripping storyline.",

It's an epic historical drama that tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who leads a rebellion against English rule in the late 13th century. If you're looking for another option, \"The Last Samurai\" is also a great choice - it's a beautifully shot film set in 19th-century Japan about a former American soldier who becomes a samurai warrior.",
