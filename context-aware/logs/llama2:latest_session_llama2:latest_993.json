With an all-star voice cast, including Brad Bird, Patton Oswalt, and John Ratzenberger, this film is sure to delight audiences of all ages. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more recent and thought-provoking movie, \"Chain Reaction\" (1996) offers a unique perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on small businesses. With interviews from business owners in Maine, the documentary sheds light on the challenges they've faced and how they've adapted to running their businesses during these unprecedented times.",
