The movies I recommended are historical dramas that depict the actions of Hitler and his followers during World War II, but they do not promote any form of hate or discrimination.\n\nIf you're interested in watching one of these movies, I would recommend \"Inglourious Basterds\" as it is a thought-provoking and entertaining film that explores the atrocities committed by Hitler and his Nazi regime during World War II. The movie features an impressive cast, including Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and M\u00e9lanie Laurent, who deliver outstanding performances.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider \"Valkyrie,\" which is based on the true story of the plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944. The movie features a talented cast, including Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, and Alexandra Maria Lara, and it provides a fascinating insight into the political climate of Nazi Germany during World War II.",
