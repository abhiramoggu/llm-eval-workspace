The plot is so intense - NASA hires a team of deep-drilling oil rig workers to save the world from a massive asteroid that's on a collision course with Earth.\n\nOr if you'd like something a bit more unique, I think \"Life of Pi\" would be an excellent choice! It's not your typical disaster movie, but it does feature a stunning survival story at sea. The visuals and storytelling are simply breathtaking, and the bond between Pi and his tiger companion is quite unforgettable.\n\nWhich one of these disasters sounds like your cup of tea?",
