However, when a power failure occurs on the island, the cloned dinosaurs escape from their enclosures and begin to roam the island, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go.\nAs a result of the escaped cloned dinosaurs causing chaos and destruction wherever they go, a group of scientists who were involved in creating the island where the cloned dinosaurs were created and studied, come together on the island to try to contain and stop the escaped cloned dinosaurs from causing further chaos and destruction wherever they go.\nThroughout the course of the movie, we see various characters, including members of the team of scientists who were involved in creating the island where the cloned dinosaurs were created and studied, as well as various other characters, including a group of tourists who are visiting the island where the cloned dinosaurs were created and studied, and also various other characters, including a group of scientists who are conducting research at a nearby facility, and also various other characters, including a group of military personnel who are serving in a nearby base.",

The story follows Tris, a young woman who discovers that she is Divergent, meaning that she has unique abilities that make her different from everyone else. When Tris discovers that there are other Divergents in the world, she and a group of Divergents known as the Four must go on a dangerous journey to find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it' s too late.\nIn this movie, the main characters are Tris and her best friends, Four (Eliot), Red (Alice), and Indi (Hanna). They all have unique abilities that make them different from everyone else. These abilities range from being able, for example, to read minds or manipulate reality to having the ability, for example, to fly or control fire.",
