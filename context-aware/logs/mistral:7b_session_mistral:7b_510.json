It's a compelling exploration of class divides and the human struggle for equality.\n\nIf you fancy something a bit different, \"Restless\" (2006) might be up your alley too. This film, featuring Mia Wasikowska and Hayley Atwell, is a poignant coming-of-age story about a group of friends navigating their final summer of freedom. It's a beautiful portrayal of youth, love, and loss. Enjoy the cinematic journey!",
