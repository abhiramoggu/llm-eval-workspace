It's a must-see for anyone interested in history.\n\nAnother great option is \"12 Years a Slave\" - this film is based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. It's a powerful and moving portrayal of one of the darkest periods in American history.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
