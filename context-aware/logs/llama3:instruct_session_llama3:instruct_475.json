It's a classic tale of human nature and decay, set on a deserted island where a group of schoolboys' savagery is unleashed. The film adaptation, starring James Aubrey and Tom Chapin, really brings this thought-provoking story to life.\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I'd be happy to recommend \"The Moon Is Down\" instead! It's another great example of a novel-turned-film, set during the Nazi occupation of Norway. The movie features some incredible performances and a powerful message about resistance and courage in the face of adversity.",
