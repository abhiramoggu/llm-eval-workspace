This film is a powerful and poignant portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II's reaction to Princess Diana's passing, brought to life by an impressive cast including Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen. It's a thought-provoking and emotional ride that explores the complexities of royalty and human nature.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more action-packed, \"Shattered\" (1973) might be up your alley! This 70s classic has a fantastic cast, including Tom Berenger and Bob Hoskins, and features a thrilling tale of detectives taking down a Russian crime boss. It's a real nail-biter that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.",
