On the surface it seems like the perfect neighborhood. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. But the pastoral exterior conceals a dark past and an even darker secret. As a group of individuals (each with their own ties and agendas with the town and each other)) converge on the enclave, strange things begin to happen. Very strange things. Strange enough to test (and then break) the very fabric of reality itself.\n- Title: The Nanny  | Plot: A wealthy couple hire a young girl from Finland to take care of their newborn. These new parents should be in a state of bliss, so why does it seem like they are trying to kill each other?",
