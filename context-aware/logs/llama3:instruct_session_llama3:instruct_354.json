The film features Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy as they navigate their feelings for each other amidst societal pressures.\n\nIf you'd like something more recent, \"Witless Protection\" (2008) might be a good fit. It's an action-comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, which could provide some much-needed laughs. The plot follows a small-town sheriff as he tries to protect a beautiful woman from an attempted kidnapping, leading to all sorts of wacky misadventures.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
