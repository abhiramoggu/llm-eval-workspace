The movie follows an over-the-hill journalist who tries to uncover evidence of a death row inmate's innocence before his execution. It's a gripping and thought-provoking thriller that explores themes of justice, morality, and the legal system.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, I suggest \"Pain & Gain\" starring Dwayne Johnson and Ed Harris. This action-comedy follows a trio of bodybuilders who get caught up in an extortion ring and a kidnapping scheme that goes terribly wrong.
