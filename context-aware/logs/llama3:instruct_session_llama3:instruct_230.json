Starring Danny Aiello, Garrett Morris, and Paul Sorvino, this campy classic follows the rise and fall of a mysterious dessert sensation that takes over the world.\n\nIf you're looking for something more uplifting, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) is a timeless classic that explores themes of self-discovery and the human spirit. With a star-studded cast, including James Stewart and Donna Reed, this heartwarming film will leave you feeling hopeful and inspired.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
