You'll be on the edge of your seat as a tank crew battles their way across Germany in the final days of World War II.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more fast-paced and gory, \"Unnatural\" (2015) might be right up your alley. This horror-thriller is all about a group of friends who find themselves being hunted by a genetically modified monster. With its non-stop action and jump scares, this one's sure to keep you on your toes!",
