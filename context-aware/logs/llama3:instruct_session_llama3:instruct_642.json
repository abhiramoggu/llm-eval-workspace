It's a beautiful exploration of human connection and the power of shared experiences, featuring Albert Delpy in a poignant performance as Jesse. The film has a strong focus on character development and is an excellent choice if you're looking for a thought-provoking experience.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
