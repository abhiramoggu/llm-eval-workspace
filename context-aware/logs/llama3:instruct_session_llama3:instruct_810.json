Considering you're fascinated by \"Escape from New York\" and looking for a dystopian story, I'd recommend either \"Divergent\" (2011) or \"Chain Reaction\" (1996).\n\n\"Divergent\" is an action-packed ride set in a world where society is divided into factions, and Tris's discovery of her Divergent nature sets off a thrilling adventure. You might enjoy the sci-fi elements and strong female lead.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something more grounded in reality, \"Chain Reaction\" is a thought-provoking documentary that explores how small businesses adapt to the challenges of the pandemic. It's a unique and engaging look at resilience and community.\n\nLet me know which one piques your interest!",
