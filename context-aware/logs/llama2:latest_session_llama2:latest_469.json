If you're in the mood for a soundtrack movie with an interesting plot and great actors, I would recommend \"Maleficent\" starring Angelina Jolie Pitt. The film follows a vengeful fairy who discovers that the child of a king could be the one person who can restore peace to their troubled land. Additionally, \"Elysium\" starring Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley is another great option. In this movie, a man takes on a mission that could bring equality to a polarized world, set in a futuristic society where the wealthy live on a man-made space station while the rest of the population resides on a ruined Earth. Both of these movies offer an engaging and thought-provoking experience!",
