It's a satirical comedy-drama that follows the lives of two aspiring politicians and their personal struggles.\n* \"Annie Hall\" (1977) stars Diane Keaton and Woody Allen in a romantic comedy that explores the ups and downs of relationships.

The film explores themes of compliance, obedience, and the blurring of lines between right and wrong, which I think would resonate with your preference for something deeper.
