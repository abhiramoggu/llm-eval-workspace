One day while wandering through a cave, Aladdin finds a magical lamp that contains within it a genie, a powerful and benevolent being who has been imprisoned for thousands of years. Upon Aladdin's release from his prison cell, the genie granted Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin wished for an army to defeat Jafar's army. The genie granted this wish, but also warned Aladdin that granting wishes is dangerous, as it could lead to consequences that are difficult to predict and control. With this warning in mind, Aladdin decided not to grant his last wish, which was to have eternal life. Instead, Aladdin wished for the return of his lost love, a beautiful princess named Jasmine. The genie granted this wish, but also warned Aladdin that granting wishes is dangerous, as it could lead to consequences that are difficult to predict and control.
