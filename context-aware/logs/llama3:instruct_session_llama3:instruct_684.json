Alternatively, if you're open to a more fantastical tale with a strong plot, \"Wolf\" (1994) is a great choice - it follows a publisher who becomes a demon wolf, starring David Hyde Pierce!\n\nWould either of these interest you?",

You'll love the nostalgic value and strong performances from Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, and Sam Shepard.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more lighthearted, \"Maid in Manhattan\" (2002) could be a fun watch! This romantic comedy stars Jennifer Lopez as a talented actress who falls for a wealthy guy, played by Ralph Fiennes. It's a delightful tale of love and self-discovery set against the vibrant backdrop of New York City.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
