Patton's career, played by George C. Scott. It's a classic film with great performances and historical significance.\n\nIf you're looking for something more directly related to Germany, I could also recommend \"Blade Runner\" (1982), which has some themes and visuals that might interest you. While not exclusively German, it features Rutger Hauer, who played a significant role in the film.",
