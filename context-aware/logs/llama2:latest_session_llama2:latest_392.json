With a star-studded cast including Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and Alfred Hitchcock, this classic thriller is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more recent and action-packed, then \"Fast Five\" might be up your alley. This high-octane heist film features an all-star cast, including Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, and Michelle Rodriguez, as they plan and execute a massive heist while being pursued by a ruthless drug lord and a determined federal agent. Both of these movies are definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for a gripping and entertaining film!",
