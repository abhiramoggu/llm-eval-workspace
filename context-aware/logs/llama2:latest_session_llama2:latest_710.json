The movie follows a young man named Ari who doesn't do relationships or attachments, until he meets Tiina and her group of friends. With a talented cast including Mia Wasikowska, Hayley Atwell, and Charlotte Rampling, this movie is sure to leave you feeling invested in the characters and their journey.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a classic epic film, \"Patton\" (1970) is a must-see. This biographical drama follows the career of controversial American general George S. Patton during World War II, and features an impressive cast including George C. Scott and Karl Malden. The movie is known for its historical accuracy and powerful performances, making it a standout in the epic genre.",

Alternatively, if you're looking for something more intense and historical, 1900 might be up your alley.
