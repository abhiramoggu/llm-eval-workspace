With an all-star cast including Robert De Niro and Brad Pitt, this film is sure to leave you feeling emotionally invested.",

And with Julia Ormond starring as the intelligent and determined Smilla, you're in for a treat!\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more lighthearted, The Taming of the Shrew is a fun and witty romp through 16th-century Italy.
