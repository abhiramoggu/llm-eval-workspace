It's a thought-provoking drama that explores themes of family and identity, starring Marc Blucas, Alexander Gould, and Ethan Embry. The story follows a British couple raising their child gender-open, offering a unique perspective on modern parenting.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more adventurous, I'd recommend \"The Patriot\" (2000) instead! This historical epic stars Mel Gibson as a farmer-turned-warrior fighting against the British during the American Revolution. With its stunning cinematography and intense action sequences, it's an exciting ride from start to finish.",
