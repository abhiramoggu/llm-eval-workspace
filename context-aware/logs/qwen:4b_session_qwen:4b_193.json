The movie also has a famous line \"Happiness is contagious.\" which is spoken by Mr. George Washington Crockett to his friend Mr. John Henry Landis.\n2. Holes (1998) directed by Aaron Sorkin and starring Tim Robbins, Jennifer Connelly, and Kevin Spacey.)\nThe movie is about the life of a young man named Itzik. The movie starts with a scene where Itzik receives a message about the murder of his son Danny. The moment Itzik received the message about the murder of his son Danny, his only son, his life would never again be the same.\nTen years of legal proceedings and new disclosures made during that time have slowly crumbled his faith in gaining justice. Along with as much pain as his loss, he realizes that only he can find the truth of what happened that night. His journey in search of the truth reveals his complex identity for the first time: a spy who worked for the security services, an Arab who converted and became a practicing Jew, a man who felt pride, respect and sympathy for a country that has absurdly and horrifyingly betrayed him.\n3. Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886) directed by Edwin Sabin and starring John Barrymore, Mary Pickford, and Lionel Barbra.)\nThe movie is based on the novel \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" written by C.S. Lewis and published in 1905. The movie follows the life of a young boy named Ralph who lives with his rich aunt and uncle.\nRalph is given to believe that he is the son of God, which is the basis for his religious beliefs. Ralph also believes that he has been blessed by his aunt and uncle because they have given him money to support himself.\nAs Ralph grows older, he begins to question the validity of his religious beliefs. Ralph also becomes aware of the inconsistencies in his aunt and uncle's financial records, which suggests that there may be some financial impropriety taking place within the Fauntleroy household.\nIn order to uncover the truth behind the financial impropriety taking place within the Fauntleroy household, Ralph decides to seek out the assistance of an expert private detective named John Henry Landis.",
