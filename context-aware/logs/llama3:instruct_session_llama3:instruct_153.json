Mickey Rourke's performance as Frank Bass is particularly noteworthy - he brings a depth and nuance to the character that makes it hard not to feel for him.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted, \"Louie\" might be up your alley! It's a quirky and offbeat film that follows the daily routine of Louie Evans as he rides around Boston on his tricycle, yelling at people to get their attention. It's a unique and charming film that explores themes of community and understanding through the eyes of an eccentric protagonist.\n\nI think you can probably guess that \"Paradise Lost\" is more of a horror movie, and \"Divergent\" is a sci-fi action film, so I didn't include those in my recommendations.",
