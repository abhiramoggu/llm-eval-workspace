It stars Corbin Bernsen, Joanne Whalley, Tom Berenger, Theodore Bikel, Bob Hoskins, Nicholas Lea, Gerard Butler, Callum Rennie.\n\nThe second movie I would suggest is \"The Secret of My Success\" which also starred the same actors that were in \"Shattered\". This movie tells the story about a young constable who works under an older and more experienced detective. The younger detective always seems to be one step ahead of his older colleague, and he always seems to have a great plan for himself as well.",
