Tom Cruise stars as the titular character, a former military police officer turned drifter who helps solve a complex case involving a mass shooting. With its fast-paced action and clever plot twists, this one's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in a historical drama that explores the early days of aerial warfare, \"Flyboys\" (2006) might be right up your alley. The film tells the inspiring true story of young American pilots who volunteered to fight for France during World War I, and features a talented cast, including James Franco.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",

It's a hilarious and quirky film that's all about exploring what makes something truly special - in this case, rock music. With an all-star cast including Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, it's a laugh-out-loud comedy that will have you nodding your head along with the beats.\n\nIf military-themed movies are more up your alley, I'd suggest \"Paycheck\" instead!
