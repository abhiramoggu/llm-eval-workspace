This thriller centers around a man who becomes increasingly obsessed with a novel he believes was written about him, and as more similarities between himself and his literary alter ego emerge, the line between reality and fiction starts to blur.\n\nAnother option that might interest you is \"Lord of the Flies\" (1954). This classic film explores themes from William Golding's novel, portraying a group of schoolboys stranded on an island who degenerate into savagery as they try to govern themselves. Both films are thought-provoking and offer unique perspectives on the power of literature and its impact on our lives. Enjoy the movies!",
