It's a tense, psychological horror film that takes place in an abandoned mental hospital with a dark history. The cast, including Larry Fessenden and Paul Guilfoyle, do a fantastic job of bringing out the eerie atmosphere and unease that pervades the story.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more artsy and cerebral, I'd recommend \"Black Swan\". It's a critically acclaimed film that delves into the world of ballet and features a standout performance from Natalie Portman. The movie explores themes of sanity, paranoia, and the blurring of reality, which might appeal to your taste in psychological horror.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
