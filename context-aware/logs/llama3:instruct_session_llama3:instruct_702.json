It's a classic Western drama set around the turn of the 20th century, with stunning winter landscapes and a gripping storyline about family dynamics and hunting. The film stars Harvey Keitel and Madeline Carroll, and it's a great example of 20th century storytelling.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more nostalgic and artsy, \"That Summer\" (1996) could be right up your alley. It's a fascinating documentary-style film that explores the life and work of photographer Peter Beard, with cameos from Lee Radziwill and other notable figures.",
