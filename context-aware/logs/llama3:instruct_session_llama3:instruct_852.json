It's an adventure classic with Kevin Dillon and Stacy Keach, set in the 18th century wilderness. While it isn't entirely in B&W, it has some great scenes with a gritty, old-fashioned feel that might appeal to you.\n\nIf you'd like something more straightforwardly black-and-white, I can recommend \"Virgin Territory\" (2007). It's an Italian film based on a medieval story, featuring young actors like Hayden Christensen and David Walliams. The movie has a lively, romantic atmosphere, with beautiful cinematography that might transport you to another era.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
