Starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Carrie Preston, Dan Hedaya, Andrew McCarthy.\n'Kundun', released in 1997 and based on the memoirs of His Holiness Tenzin Tractsob Kunga Thuthob Tsarong, is a historical drama film directed by Zhang Yimou. The film stars Baoqiang Wang, Gong Li, Fan Bingbing, Song Zhenhe. In 'Kundun', we see how the Chinese people's attitude towards Buddhism evolved over time, and how the new era of modernization brought about new changes in the way that people viewed Buddhism.\nOverall, both 'Doubt' and 'Kundun' are excellent drama films with well-developed characters and compelling storylines.",
