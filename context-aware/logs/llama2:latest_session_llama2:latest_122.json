Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more sci-fi oriented, I recommend checking out \"2010.\" This joint USA-Soviet expedition movie follows a team of astronauts as they uncover the secrets of Jupiter and the mysterious H.A.L. 9000 computer. With a talented cast including Roy Scheider, Candice Bergen, and Arthur C. Clarke, this film is sure to provide an exciting and thought-provoking experience.",
