Based on your interest in the genre, I think you might enjoy \"Gone Girl\" (2014) - it's a twisty, suspenseful film that explores the darker side of human nature, and its complex characters will keep you guessing until the very end. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more mind-bending, I'd suggest \"Shutter Island\" (2010), which is a gripping, atmospheric mystery that plays with your perceptions and keeps you on the edge of your seat!",
