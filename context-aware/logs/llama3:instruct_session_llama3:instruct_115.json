If you're in the mood for something a bit more eerie and atmospheric, I'd highly recommend \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" (1843) - it's a classic tale of psychological horror that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The fact that it's an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's short story only adds to its gothic charm!\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more modern and character-driven, I think \"Eve's Bayou\" (1997) would be a great choice. It's a beautifully shot film with a fantastic cast, including Lynn Whitfield and Diahann Carroll, that explores the secrets and mystic forces at play within an affluent family in Louisiana.",
