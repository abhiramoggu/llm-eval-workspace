This clever film plays with the concept of documentary filmmaking, following a team as they search for the elusive Loch Ness monster. With Werner Herzog's dry wit and deadpan delivery, it's a hilarious and entertaining ride.\n\nIf that doesn't pique your interest, I'd also recommend \"The Last Dragon\" (1985). While not strictly a mockumentary, this cult classic has a fun, documentary-style opening that sets the tone for the rest of the film. It's a lighthearted, campy romp with plenty of '80s charm.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
