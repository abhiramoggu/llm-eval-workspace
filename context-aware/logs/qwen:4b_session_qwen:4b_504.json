Having offended Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Odysseus is thwarted at every turn in his voyage, and even passes through the realm of the dead before reaching Ithaka, his kingdom. The epic hints at what it might mean to travel to wage war, to then try to return to the point of departure, and to have both left behind and carried home chaos.\n   - Starring: Vanessa L. Williams, Eric Roberts, Bernadette Peters, Isabella Rossellini, Irene Papas, Geraldine Chaplin, Christopher Lee\n2. You (2014))\n   - Plot: A husband-and-wife team play detective, but not in the traditional sense.
