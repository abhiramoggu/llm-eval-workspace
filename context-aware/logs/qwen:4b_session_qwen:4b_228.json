The movie features an ensemble cast consisting of Chris Ellis, Joseph Sikora, Keanu Reeves, and many more talented actors who bring their unique skills and talents to the screen and help create some truly memorable movies.\n2) The Watcher (2000)\nThis movie tells the story of Joel Campbell, a former FBI agent who gets so frustrated by his failure to capture Griffin in Los Angeles, that he quits the FBI, moves to Chicago, and remains in psychiatric therapy, unable to function normally. Then he realizes, when opening his mail very late, that a new murder victim is Griffin' s, and the killer sent him pictures of her. Campbell reports this to the police, but is unwilling to join them in the search, suggesting Griffin is too slick and clever; yet he won' t get out of it that easily.",
