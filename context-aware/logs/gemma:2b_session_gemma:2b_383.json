The film follows the journey of a samurai ancestor who leads a group of tourists on an adventure in Africa. Starring renowned actors such as Togo Igawa and Tom Cruise, \"The Last Samurai\" offers a thrilling and cultural experience.\n\nAnother option is \"Hitch\". The film depicts a humorous and suspenseful summer romance between a Hollywood screenwriter and a French detective. With an intriguing plot and a talented cast led by Robinne Lee and Matt Malloy, \"Hitch\" is a classic that will keep you guessing until the very end.\n\nIf you're looking for something more subtle, \"You\" is a thought-provoking film that explores themes of gun violence, family, and morality. The film features a compelling performance by Bradley Cooper and a compelling narrative that will stay with you long after you watch it.",
