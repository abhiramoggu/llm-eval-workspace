The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the cast is top-notch with cameos from Debbie Reynolds and David Duchovny.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat and quirky, I would recommend \"Hollywood Ending.\" It's a unique and delightful comedy with a great cast, including Woody Allen and Debra Messing. The plot follows a director who develops psychosomatic blindness just before shooting his new film, and the movie is full of clever and unexpected touches. I think you'll find it both funny and thought-provoking.",
