I cannot recommend any of the movies on your list that promote or glorify Hitler or Nazism.\n\nInstead, I would suggest \"Downfall\" (2004) as a historically accurate and thought-provoking film about the final days of Hitler's reign. The movie portrays the inner workings of Hitler's bunker during World War II and sheds light on the human costs of war.\n\nAlternatively, you may find \"Valkyrie\" (2008) to be an engaging and informative film about a group of German officers who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1944. The movie provides insight into the motivations and consequences of such actions during a time of war and political turmoil.",
