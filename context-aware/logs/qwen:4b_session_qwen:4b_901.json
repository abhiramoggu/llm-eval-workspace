The story revolves around five criminals who are brought together by an apparently random police lineup. As the story unfolds, the five criminals become increasingly entangled with each other and the authorities, leading to a dramatic finale that leaves viewers questioning their own assumptions about the world.\n2. \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1987) directed by Oliver Stone is a powerful drama that explores the life of author J.D. Salinger. The film begins with Salinger's death in 1965, and then follows Salinger's life from his childhood in New York City to his later years as an recluse living in the Catskill Mountains. Throughout the film, Salinger is portrayed as a complex and troubled individual who struggled with his identity and his place in the world. The film ultimately leaves viewers questioning their own assumptions about the world and the complexity of human experience.",
