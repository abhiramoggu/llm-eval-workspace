However, if you're looking for a Batman-themed movie, I'd recommend 'Maleficent' (2014) starring Angelina Jolie Pitt. While it doesn't feature the Dark Knight himself, the film offers an interesting twist on fairy tale villains which might appeal to your taste.\n\nIf you're open to science fiction, 'Elysium' (2013) featuring Matt Damon could be another intriguing option, set in a future where the very wealthy live on a space station while the rest of Earth is in ruins. It has a different setting but shares an element of class struggle that some Batman fans might appreciate. Enjoy your movie time!",
