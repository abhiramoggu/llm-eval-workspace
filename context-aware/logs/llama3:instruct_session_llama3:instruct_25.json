This film tells an incredible true story of heroism and humanity during times of war and conflict, starring Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. It's a gripping and thought-provoking movie that will leave you feeling moved and inspired.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for a more intense action-thriller, \"War\" (2007) might be up your alley!
