The film features a great soundtrack and a standout performance from Beckinsale.\n* \"The Right Stuff\" (1983) - This historical drama follows the early days of the U.S. space program, with a talented cast including Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, and Ed Harris. The film has a great soundtrack and is sure to appeal to fans of historical dramas.\n\nBoth of these movies offer a unique sound and linguistics-related themes that I think the user will enjoy!",
