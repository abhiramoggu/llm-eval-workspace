I think \"She's the Man\" is a great choice, as it's a fun and lighthearted take on the sports genre with a unique twist. The film stars Alexandra Breckenridge as a high school student who disguises herself as her brother to play on the boys' soccer team, leading to a hilarious romp of romantic confusion. Alternatively, \"Young Frankenstein\" is another classic comedy that combines elements of horror and sports in a memorable way. The film stars Mel Brooks as the grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who inherits his family's castle and decides to continue his grandfather's experiments with hilarious consequences.",
