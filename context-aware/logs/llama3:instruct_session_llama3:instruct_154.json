If you're looking for a classic horror movie that still holds up today, I highly recommend \"The Conjuring\" - it's a well-crafted and chilling film based on the true story of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something more modern and thought-provoking, \"Get Out\" is a great choice - it's a clever blend of horror and social commentary that will keep you on your toes.",
