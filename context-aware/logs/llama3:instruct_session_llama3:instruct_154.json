This historical drama tells the story of Lance Summer, who is struggling to find his place in life after World War II. The film is an intense and thought-provoking portrayal of human nature, with strong performances from the cast.\n\nIf you're interested in something a bit more lighthearted, \"The Secret of My Success\" (1987) might be a good choice. Although it's not directly about the Bible, its themes of perseverance and faith are certainly inspired by biblical values. Plus, Michael J. Fox is always entertaining!",
