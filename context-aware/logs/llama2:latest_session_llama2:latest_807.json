It's a great choice for fans of live music and McCartney's work. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more mysterious and suspenseful, I recommend \"Frailty.\" This movie follows a man who receives visions from his father to destroy people he believes are demons, and it features a talented cast including Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey.
