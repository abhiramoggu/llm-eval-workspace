The plot revolves around Jack Passion, who has defied social convention and become an ambassador for the sport of competitive beard growing. Through good times and bad, he has pushed on to become the two time world beard champion. He shares this inspirational story with us and guides us through his world in a 6 minute narrative doc. He considers what his world has become due to his beard and contemplates the thought of a world without.",
