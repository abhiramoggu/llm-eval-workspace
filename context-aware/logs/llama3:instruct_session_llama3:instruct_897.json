Based on your interest in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", I think you might enjoy \"Siddhartha\" (1922) - an early classic that explores themes of existence and human nature, much like Harper Lee's masterpiece. The film is based on Hermann Hesse's novel of the same name, which has been widely acclaimed for its thought-provoking and introspective storytelling.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more recent, I'd recommend \"Neighbors\" (2014) - an animated film that may not be directly related to your original query, but does involve killing (of sorts!) and features a talented voice cast. It's a lighthearted and humorous take on the consequences of unchecked aggression.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
