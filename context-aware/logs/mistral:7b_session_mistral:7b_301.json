The cast is truly star-studded with Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman joining the ensemble!\n\nOn the other hand, \"Waterworld\" is another intriguing option set in a post-apocalyptic world where most of Earth is submerged underwater. Kevin Costner's character navigates through this dystopian landscape, fighting for survival against various threats while helping a woman and a young girl search for dry land.
