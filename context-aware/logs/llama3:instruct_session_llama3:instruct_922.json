This 90s comedy stars Eddie Murphy as a shy professor who turns into a suave ladies' man after taking a magical potion. It's a hilarious and lighthearted romp with plenty of witty one-liners and memorable characters.",

The film features stunning visuals, intense action sequences, and strong performances from its cast.\n\nIf you're looking for something more grounded in reality, \"Redacted\" is a powerful war drama that explores the human cost of conflict. Directed by Brian De Palma, this 2007 film follows a group of American soldiers on patrol in Iraq and the devastating consequences of their actions. The film features a talented cast, including Ohad Knoller and Kel O'Neill.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions about these films!",
