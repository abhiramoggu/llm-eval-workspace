The movie features a great cast, including Helen Hunt, Alan Alda, and Marisa Tomei, and it's sure to bring some laughs.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat and quirky, \"I Heart Huckabees\" is definitely worth checking out. It's a unique and thought-provoking comedy with a talented cast, including Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, and Naomi Watts.
