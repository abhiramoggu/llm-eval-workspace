This 1900 adaptation follows the story of a sea captain who's determined to redeem himself after being discredited as a coward. The themes of regret and second chances are woven throughout the narrative.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more introspective and thought-provoking, I'd suggest \"Island\". This 1962 film tells the story of a man lost at sea who finds himself on an island. The exploration of his past mistakes and struggles to come to terms with his new reality might strike a chord with you.\n\nBoth movies have a strong focus on character development and introspection, which I think would be a great match for your interests!",
