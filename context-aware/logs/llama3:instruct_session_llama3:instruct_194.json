This epic miniseries is based on Ken Follett's bestseller and takes place during the 14th century. With a star-studded cast, including Caroline Langrishe and Jeremy Lopez, it's a must-see for anyone who loves historical dramas.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern, \"The Purge\" (2013) is a great choice. This thrilling film takes place in an alternate universe where once a year, all crime becomes legal. With Adelaide Kane, Rhys Wakefield, and Chris Mulkey delivering standout performances, it's a wild ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat!",

It's an action-packed thriller with a clever premise that explores what happens when a man wakes up without any memory of who he is or how he got there. The film stars Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman, and has plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.",
