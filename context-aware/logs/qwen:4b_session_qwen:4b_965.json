The movie stars Frank Grillo as Bruce Banner, a scientist on the run from the U. S. Government, must find a cure for the monster he turns into whenever he loses his temper.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Warrior\" is an epic action-adventure film based on actual events. The movie stars Tom Hardy as Hindu warrior Rama in ancient India, who must embark on a quest to rescue his wife and kill the evil king Hyder. Alongside him are a group of warriors who have joined Rama's quest.\n\nOverall, \"Matched\" is more focused on characters and their journey, while \"Warrior\" is more focused on epic battles and action sequences.",
