It's a hilarious sequel to the first movie with some memorable moments and quotable lines.\n\nIf you're interested in something with a more thought-provoking and philosophical tone, \"Looper\" (2012) starring Tracie Thoms, Paul Dano, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great choice. It's a film about the cyclical nature of time and how it can lead to tragedy.",
