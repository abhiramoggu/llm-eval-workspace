The film is full of twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more cerebral, I'd recommend \"Memento\" (2000). This mind-bending thriller tells the story of a man with short-term memory loss who sets out to avenge his wife's murder. The film's unique reverse-chronological structure will keep you guessing and emotionally invested in the protagonist's quest for justice.",
