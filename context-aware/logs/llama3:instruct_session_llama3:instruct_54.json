This campy cult favorite stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who must battle an army of the dead to return home. With its over-the-top action and witty one-liners, this film is sure to bring on some laughs and zombie-filled fun!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more modern and romantic, \"Zoo\" (2012) could be just what you need. This indie thriller follows a couple trying to save their marriage amidst a zombie apocalypse - it's a unique take on the genre that explores human relationships in the face of chaos.\n\nWhich one tickles your fancy?",
