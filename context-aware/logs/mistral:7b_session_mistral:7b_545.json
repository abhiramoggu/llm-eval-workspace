This captivating film tells the story of a vengeful fairy who curses an infant princess, but later discovers that the child could be the one person to restore peace to their troubled land. Starring Angelina Jolie Pitt and Sam Riley, it's definitely worth checking out!\n\nIf you're interested in another folklore-inspired movie, I'd also recommend \"The Whistler\" (2016). This film features a gentle giant defending his love against a band of thugs that enter a small town, leading to an epic showdown. While the cast for this movie isn't listed here, it promises a thrilling tale of loyalty and courage. Enjoy your viewing!",
