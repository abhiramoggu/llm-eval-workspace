In this film, Chris Evans portrays Steve Rogers who transforms into Captain America, leading the fight against a warmonger and terrorist organization.

This film revolves around a manmade combat virus causing death and insanity in a small Pennsylvania town. It's a gripping story that delves into the darker side of human nature during times of crisis. Enjoy your movie time!",
