It's an inspiring film about a high school basketball coach who uses his team's season as a chance to teach them about responsibility. The movie stars Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Ri'chard.\n\nFor a more traditional basketball movie, you might enjoy \"Glory Road\" (2006). This film tells the true story of Don Haskins, who coached the first all-African American starting lineup for Texas Western College in a 1966 NCAA championship game. Starring Josh Lucas and Derek Luke. Enjoy the games!",
