The films feature memorable performances from Bruce Campbell and Kassie Wesley DePaiva in \"Evil Dead II\", and Bette Midler and Nathan Lane in \"Isn't She Great\". I hope you enjoy them!",

The movie follows a young family who moves into a new house, unaware of its dark past, and the unexplained events that unfold. It stars Russ Tamblyn, Claire Bloom, Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Virginia Madsen, and Lois Maxwell. On the other hand, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (N/A) is an entertaining movie that combines comedy and drama with a unique plot twist. Starring Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson, it follows an I.R.S. auditor who suddenly finds his life being narrated by an unknown voice, leading to unexpected changes in his life.
