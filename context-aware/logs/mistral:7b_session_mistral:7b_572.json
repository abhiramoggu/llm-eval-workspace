The story revolves around Marion Crane, played by the talented Janet Leigh, who, after stealing money from her employer, finds herself at a remote motel with some unsettling secrets of its own. It's a classic that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit different but still set in California, \"The Kite Runner\" is another excellent choice. Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, this film follows Amir as he returns to his homeland after years in California to help an old friend and confront his past. It's a moving story that beautifully explores themes of friendship, redemption, and the complexities of identity. Enjoy your movie time!",
