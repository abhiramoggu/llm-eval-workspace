This ancient epic tells the story of Odysseus, a Greek prince who was forced to flee his kingdom after the fall of Troy in 148 BC. Odysseus travels across Europe and Asia before finally returning to Ithaca, where he reigns as king.\n\nMy second recommendation is \"The Equalizer\" by James Wilcox. This movie tells the story of David Callahan, a former Los Angeles police officer who has become a wealthy private detective with an unparalleled reputation for getting answers.\n\nCallahan takes on cases that no one else wants to handle, such as the murder of a young girl, the disappearance of a wealthy businessman, and the discovery of a top-secret government weapon.\n\nDespite his reputation, Callahan is often forced to work alone or with just a few trusted associates in order to protect himself from being too closely watched by law enforcement officials.",
