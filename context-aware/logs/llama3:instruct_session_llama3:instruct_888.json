Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a secret agent who must stop terrorists from smuggling nuclear warheads into the US while dealing with his wife's possible infidelity. It's an iconic '90s spy movie with plenty of laughs and thrilling chases!\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more grounded in reality, \"Patriot Games\" (1987) is a great choice. This Tom Clancy adaptation stars Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who finds himself caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse with IRA terrorists. It's a gripping thriller that explores the human side of espionage.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if one of these movies sparks your interest!",
