This classic dystopian drama, based on Margaret Atwood's novel, is a powerful exploration of women's oppression and resistance under a totalitarian regime. With its thought-provoking themes and strong performances, it's a must-see for anyone interested in feminist cinema.\n\nIf you're looking for something more contemporary, \"Frida\" (2002) is another excellent choice. This biographical drama beautifully captures the life and art of Frida Kahlo, one of the most iconic female figures of the 20th century. With a talented ensemble cast, including Salma Hayek in the titular role, this film is both an intimate portrayal of Frida's personal struggles and a celebration of her artistic genius.",
