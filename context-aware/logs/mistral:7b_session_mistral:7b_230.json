A bildungsroman is a novel that chronicles the personal growth and education of a main character, typically from youth to adulthood.\n\nHowever, if we were to choose two movies from your list that could possibly provide some personal growth narratives, they would be:\n\n1. 'Mansfield Park' (1814), a classic novel-turned-film that follows Fanny Price's journey as she navigates her new life with her wealthy relatives and discovers her own values.\n2. 'You' (2014) is a television series, not a film, but it does explore the personal growth of its main character, Joe Goldberg, who undergoes significant changes as he grapples with love, obsession, and morality.",
