Starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Vivica A. Fox, it's a powerful and thought-provoking watch.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense, I'd also recommend \"The Handmaid's Tale\" - a haunting portrayal of a dystopian society where women's bodies are controlled by the ruling class. Margaret Atwood's novel was brought to life on screen in 1985, and it remains a powerful commentary on gender inequality and resistance.",
