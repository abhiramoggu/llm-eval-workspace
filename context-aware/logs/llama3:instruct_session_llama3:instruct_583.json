It's a thought-provoking film about teenage rebellion and peer pressure, set in a Catholic school. The themes are still relevant today, and it's a great exploration of adolescent struggles.\n\nOr, if you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted, I'd suggest \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" (2006). It's a heartwarming story about the special bond between a dog named Enzo and his owner, a racing driver. With Kevin Costner voicing Enzo, it's a fun and uplifting film that's hard to resist!",
