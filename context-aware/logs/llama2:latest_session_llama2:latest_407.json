Based on your preference for a movie with dance and could in the plot, I would recommend \"Moulin Rouge!\" starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. This film is a visually stunning and entertaining tale of love, music, and drama set in 1890s Paris. The movie features plenty of memorable dance numbers that are sure to leave you mesmerized. Alternatively, if you're looking for something more contemporary and full of energy, \"Step Up Revolution\" might be the perfect choice. This film follows a group of young dancers as they fight to save their neighborhood from destruction through the power of dance. With its high-octane choreography and catchy soundtrack, it's sure to get you moving and grooving!",
