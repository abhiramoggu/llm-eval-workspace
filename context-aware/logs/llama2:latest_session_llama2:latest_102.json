Wixom, and Jarrod Phillips. This movie follows a man who finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and must fight to survive with nothing but his wits and a beat-up car. If you're looking for something a bit more lighthearted, I would suggest \"Dinner for Schmucks\" starring Randall Park, Andrea Savage, and Stephanie Szostak. This movie follows a rising executive who finds himself invited to an unusual dinner party where the guests are celebrated for their... let's say, unique talents. Both of these movies offer plenty of laughs and entertainment!",
