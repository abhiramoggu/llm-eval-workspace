It's an over-the-top action film with a star-studded cast, including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis. The plot is straightforward - a team of mercenaries takes on a mission to eliminate a dictator - but the real fun comes from seeing the iconic actors go all out in their roles.",
