Hotel Rwanda is another highly recommended option, as it tells an incredibly moving true story of resistance against the Hutu genocide in Rwanda during the 1990s. Flyboys is another great option to consider, as it is a heartwarming coming-of-age drama that follows the lives of five young men from diverse backgrounds who become the first American pilot in World War I.",
