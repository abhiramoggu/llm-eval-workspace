      "text": "Of course, I'd be happy to recommend some absurdist movies based on your preferences! If you're in the mood for a classic absurdism movie with a unique blend of humor and dark themes, I highly recommend \"Shattered\" (1973) starring Corbin Bernsen, Joanne Whalley, Tom Berenger, Theodore Bikel, Bob Hoskins, Nicholas Lea, Gerard Butler, and Callum Rennie. This movie follows two detectives as they try to take down a powerful Russian crime boss with the help of a sarcastic computer hacker, while also dealing with their own personal secrets and dangers. Alternatively, if you're interested in a more modern absurdist tale with a dark and edgy tone, I suggest checking out \"True Blood\" (N/A) starring  and featuring a gritty portrayal of street gangs, frame-ups, and the struggle for survival in a dangerous neighborhood. Both of these movies are sure to provide an entertaining and thought-provoking experience!",

The plot follows their adventures in Thailand after a wild bachelor party, and it's full of unexpected twists and turns. Alternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more dark and eerie, \"Vampyres\" could be up your alley.
