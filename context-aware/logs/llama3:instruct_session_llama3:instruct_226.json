The movie's blend of humor and heart might appeal to you.\n\nAlternatively, if you're up for something a bit more offbeat, \"Lady in the Water\" (2006) could be an interesting choice. It's a unique and imaginative tale that explores themes of love, loss, and transformation, all set against a backdrop of fantasy and mystery.",

This classic tale of beauty, morality, and the supernatural has been adapted many times, but this 2009 version is particularly striking, with stunning visuals and a memorable performance from Ben Barnes as Dorian himself.",
