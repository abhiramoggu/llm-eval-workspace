Based on your interest in \"Island of the Blue Dolphins\", I'm going to recommend two war-themed movies from this list that might resonate with you.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to suggest \"American Gangster\" (2007). This partly biographical film is an intense and gripping portrayal of a real-life Harlem drug lord's rise and fall, starring Denzel Washington. The movie explores the gritty world of organized crime and the efforts of law enforcement to bring him down.\n\nAnother recommendation would be \"The Warlords\" (2007), a historical epic set in 1860s China. This film follows three bandit leaders who form an army to fight against rebels, with stunning action sequences and a gripping storyline. With a strong cast, including Jet Li, Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro, this movie is sure to keep you engaged.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",
