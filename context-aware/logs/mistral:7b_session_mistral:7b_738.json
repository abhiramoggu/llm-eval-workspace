A notable star in this film is Gary Cooper, who plays the lead role.\n\nOn the other hand, if you prefer a more contemporary film, \"Downfall\" (2004) offers an intriguing plot about a man torn between his new life and his drug-influenced past, which could prove to be his downfall. This movie stars Bruno Ganz in a compelling performance. Both films are excellent choices for anyone looking for movies set in Spain. Enjoy your viewing!",
