The story follows Ari as he navigates his feelings and connections with others, which feels quite relevant to your desire for a movie about literature.\n\nIf you'd like an alternative, I think \"The Return of the King\" (1955) could be another great fit!

It's an adaptation of John Knowles' classic novel, and it's all about the complexities of relationships and coming to terms with one's own identity. The characters are richly drawn, and the setting - a prep school in New England during WWII - adds an extra layer of depth to the story.\n\nOr, if you're open to something a bit more futuristic and visually stunning, Prometheus might be up your alley. It's a thought-provoking film that explores the consequences of playing with fire (literally!), and it features an all-star cast including Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy!",
