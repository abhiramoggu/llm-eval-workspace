This film, set in the 1960s, tells an engaging story about a criminal pleading insanity and his subsequent battle against a tyrannical nurse in a mental institution. Starring Louis Fletcher who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Nurse Ratched, it's a thought-provoking and powerful film.\n\nAnother great option is \"The Queen\", which delves into the personal struggles of Queen Elizabeth II after the death of Princess Diana. With an award-winning performance by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth, this movie offers a unique perspective on a public figure during a challenging time in her life.",
