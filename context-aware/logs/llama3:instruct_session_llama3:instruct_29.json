It's an action-packed thriller that tells the story of a young girl who grows up to be a skilled assassin after witnessing her parents' murder in Bogot\u00e1. With Zoe Saldana starring as the lead, it's a thrilling ride from start to finish.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense and emotionally charged, I'd also recommend \"Eye for an Eye\". This 1996 drama follows a mother who seeks justice when the courts fail to punish her daughter's killer. It's a powerful exploration of grief, anger, and resilience, with strong performances from Ed Harris and Beverly D'Angelo.",

It's a classic film noir set on the Mexican border, featuring an all-star cast including Orson Welles and Charlton Heston. The movie is more focused on police corruption and murder, so it might provide the suspenseful atmosphere you're looking for without being too scary.",
