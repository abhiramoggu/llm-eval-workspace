Based on your interest in biopics, I highly recommend \"A Beautiful Mind\" (2001) starring Russell Crowe as John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who struggles with schizophrenia. It's an inspiring and emotional film that won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe.\n\nIf you'd like another suggestion, I think you might enjoy \"Walk the Line\" (2005), which tells the story of Johnny Cash's life and music, starring Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. It's a fantastic portrayal of one of music's most iconic figures!",

Alternatively, if you'd like to stick with a more traditional biopic feel, \"Ray\" is a great option - it's an inspiring portrayal of Ray Charles' life and music.",

Both films feature strong performances and inspiring stories that explore the highs and lows of their subjects' lives.",
