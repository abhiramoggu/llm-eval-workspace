It's an oldie but a goodie, starring Tom Cruise as a hot-shot stock car driver who gets his chance to compete at the top level. The movie has a great mix of action and drama, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of auto racing.\n\nIf you'd rather something more modern and action-packed, I think \"Fast & Furious\" (2001) might be up your alley! It's the first installment in the popular franchise, starring Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto and Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz. The movie has plenty of high-octane racing scenes and some great action sequences to keep you entertained.\n\nLet me know if either of these strike your fancy or if you'd like more recommendations!",

It's a unique blend of horror and comedy, with Danny Aiello, Garrett Morris, and Paul Sorvino bringing it to life. The premise is just so intriguing - who wouldn't want to try some mysterious goo that turns out to have zombie-like effects?",
