Directed by Martin Scorsese, this classic film features an iconic performance by Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a taxi driver who becomes obsessed with saving a young prostitute. The film's gritty realism and social commentary will definitely keep you hooked!\n\nIf you're looking for something more light-hearted and fast-paced, I think \"Find Me Guilty\" (2006) could be an excellent choice. This comedy-drama stars Vin Diesel as Jackie DiNorscio, a mobster who defends himself in court with the help of a quirky lawyer.
