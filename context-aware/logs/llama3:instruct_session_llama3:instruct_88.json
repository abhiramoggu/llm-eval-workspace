It's a biopic that explores the life of Mark Zuckerberg, and like \"A Beautiful Mind\", it's a thought-provoking film that examines the complexities of genius.

Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more uplifting, \"The Imitation Game\" is an excellent choice - it tells the inspiring story of Alan Turing, a British mathematician who helped crack the Enigma code during WWII, and it's a beautiful tribute to his life and legacy.",
