Unleashed follows a man raised as a human attack dog who seeks revenge against his captors, while Pan's Labyrinth delves into the fantastical world of a young girl escaping her harsh reality in 1940s Spain.",

The movie is a powerful drama that explores themes of love, loss, and redemption, which I think you would find engaging.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in something more contemporary and with a focus on dance, I would suggest \"Step Up Revolution\" starring Ryan Guzman and Misha Gabriel Hamilton. The movie follows the story of two best friends who are part of a dance crew in Miami, and how their lives become intertwined with a real estate development plan that threatens their neighborhood. The film has some great dance scenes and a gripping plot that will keep you engaged.",
