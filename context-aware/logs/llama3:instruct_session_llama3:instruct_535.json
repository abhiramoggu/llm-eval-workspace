And who knows, maybe the zombie-like snackers will remind you of those pesky monsters in Frankenweenie!\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something with a bit more action and adventure, \"Total Recall\" (1990) might be up your alley. This sci-fi classic has Arnold Schwarzenegger at its center, and while it's quite different from the stop-motion charm of Frankenweenie, it shares a similar sense of excitement and thrills.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
