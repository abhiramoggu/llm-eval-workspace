Based on your preferences, I would suggest \"Player Piano\" and \"The Giver\". Both of these films explore the tension between a seemingly perfect society and the individual experiences and emotions that are often absent in such environments. In \"Player Piano\", we see how Rarity's desire to play music on a grand piano challenges the strict rules of a world where all creative expression is heavily regulated, while \"The Giver\" delves into the weighty consequences of a society that has eliminated all pain and emotion in favor of a sterile, uniform existence.
