Plus, Danny Aiello and Paul Sorvino star in this quirky film that explores what happens when something new and exciting gets out of control.\n\nIf you're not feeling the sci-fi vibe, I'd suggest \"The Bad Seed\" instead. It's a classic thriller from 1954 about an seemingly sweet little girl who might be hiding a darker secret. With its suspenseful plot and Frances Bavier's iconic performance, it's a great choice for fans of psychological mysteries.",
