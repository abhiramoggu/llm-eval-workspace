It's based on an incredible true story of Paul Rusesabagina, who risked his life to protect over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan genocide. With an all-star cast including Nick Nolte, Don Cheadle, and Joaquin Phoenix, this film is sure to move you.\n\nAnother great option would be \"Zulu\" (2013), which delves into a gripping mystery set against the backdrop of apartheid in South Africa. The film's dark and gritty atmosphere, combined with the performances of Conrad Kemp and Orlando Bloom, make it a thrilling watch.\n\nAs for \"Starship Troopers\", while it's an action-packed sci-fi movie, I think you might be looking for something more grounded in reality. And \"A Farewell to Arms\" is a classic romance drama that's not directly related to the Vietnam War, so I didn't include it in my recommendations.",
