Who knew that could be so fascinating?\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to something a bit more light-hearted and fun, \"Shark Tale\" (2004) might be up your alley!

The plot is playful and entertaining, and it's a great way to pass the time.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions about these films!",
