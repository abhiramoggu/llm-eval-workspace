As she struggles to come to terms with her fate, Hester forms an unlikely alliance with a respected Puritan minister named John Winthrop who is on his way to America as part of the first Massachusetts Colony in 1629. As he listens to Hester's harrowing story, John is struck by the incredible parallels between Hester's fateful tale and the ongoing religious strife that continues to plague the fledgling English settlement in New England, USA in the late 17th century. As he struggles to come to terms with the devastating impact of his actions on the lives of those around him, John is left to ponder the deeply ingrained moral contradictions and inherent contradictions that continue to plague the human condition, no matter how advanced the technological and scientific progress becomes in any given civilization or society",
