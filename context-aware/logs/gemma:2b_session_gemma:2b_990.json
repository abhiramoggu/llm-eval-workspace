It's a heartwarming story about a boy's bond with a deer, but it takes a dark turn when the deer misbehaves.\n\nAnother intriguing option is \"Inside Man\" (2006) starring Waris Ahluwalia, Kim Director, and Brad Leland. It's a high-octane movie about a police detective, a bank robber, and a high-power broker who are forced to negotiate after the criminal's heist spirals into a hostage situation.\n\nIf you're interested in a heist movie with a stellar cast, \"Ocean's Twelve\" (2004) starring Daniel Ocean, Jared Harris, and Eddie Jemison is a must-see. It's a thrilling sequel to Ocean's Eleven (2001) and features three major heists in Europe.",
