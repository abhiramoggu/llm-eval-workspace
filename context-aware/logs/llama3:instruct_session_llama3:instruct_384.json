If you're in the mood for a classic Western with a dash of gritty realism, I highly recommend \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) starring Clint Eastwood. This iconic film has stood the test of time and is still widely regarded as one of the greatest Westerns ever made.\n\nIf you'd like something more modern, \"3:10 to Yuma\" (2007) is a great choice. This tense thriller features Christian Bale in a strong performance as an outlaw, and Gretchen Mol shines as his love interest.",
