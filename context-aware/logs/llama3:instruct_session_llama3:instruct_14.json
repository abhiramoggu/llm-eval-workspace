This historical drama features Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role as King Louis XIV and his twin brother, Philippe. With its striking black-and-white cinematography, it's a visually stunning film that will transport you to 17th-century France.\n\nIf you're looking for something more contemporary and powerful, I also suggest \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013). This critically acclaimed film tells the harrowing true story of Solomon Northup's experiences as a free Black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. With its gripping narrative and outstanding performances, it's a must-see.",
