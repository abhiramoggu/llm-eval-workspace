Brad Pitt stars alongside Edward Norton in this cult classic about an underground fight club that explores toxic masculinity. The movie's gritty tone and thought-provoking commentary will likely resonate with you.\n\nSecondly, if you're in the mood for something more lighthearted yet still clever and witty, I suggest \"What Women Want\". Who wouldn't want to get a glimpse into what women are thinking? This 2000 comedy stars Mel Gibson as an advertising executive who acquires this peculiar ability. It's a fun, fish-out-of-water story with plenty of humor and charm.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions about these movies!",
