With an all-star cast including Ryan Phillippe and Barry Pepper, it's a must-see for anyone interested in the war.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more lighthearted that still captures the spirit of the era, \"More American Graffiti\" (N/A) might be up your alley. This film is a nostalgic and entertaining look at the lives of young adults during the mid-1960s, with cameos from some big names like Harrison Ford and Ron Howard.",
