Starring Harrison Ford as a blade runner tasked with hunting down rogue replicants, this movie has an incredible atmosphere and features a memorable cast of characters. On the opposite end of the spectrum, \"Veronica Mars\" (N/A) is a more contemporary take on the genre, with a focus on mystery and crime. This movie follows Veronica Mars, a former private eye who returns to her hometown for her high school reunion and finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation. Both of these movies are definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for a film noir!",
