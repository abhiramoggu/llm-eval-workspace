It's a comedy-drama based on a true story, starring Ron Silver and Vin Diesel. The plot follows Jackie DiNorscio as he defends himself in court, which sounds like an intriguing and entertaining story.\n\nAlternatively, if you're open to exploring something different, I think \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) could be a great fit! This classic film stars Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, and Martin Scorsese, and tells the story of a taxi driver's obsession with saving a young prostitute. It's a thought-provoking and intense movie that explores themes of isolation and redemption.\n\nLet me know if either of these options catch your eye!",

You'll be swept away by the stunning Icelandic landscapes and the cast's charming performances.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more grounded in reality, I think \"Stargirl\" (2000) would be a great choice.

With its lighthearted tone and clever humor, you might find it's just the right fit for you!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something completely different but still enjoy Nicholas Bell (Marshall Bell), I'd suggest \"Total Recall\" (1990).
