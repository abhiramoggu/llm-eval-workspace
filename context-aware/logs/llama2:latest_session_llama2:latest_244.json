Meanwhile, \"Uptown Girls\" follows a grown-up woman who keeps her childish instincts and behavior as she takes on the role of a nanny for an 8-year-old girl who surprisingly acts like an adult.

Another great option would be \"The War of the Worlds\" (1897), which is a classic science fiction novel written by H.G. Wells that has been adapted into numerous films over the years.
