It's a thought-provoking film that explores the themes of identity and purpose through the lens of an actress who's lost her way after quitting performing. With a talented cast including Melora Walters, Theresa Randle, and Ellen Barkin, it's a great choice if you're in the mood for something more introspective.\n\nOr, if you'd like to try something a bit more lighthearted, \"The Last Dragon\" could be a fun pick! It's a retro classic that combines martial arts with music and humor, featuring Vanity as the lead singer of a rock band. With its funky vibes and Chazz Palminteri in a memorable role, it's an entertaining ride from start to finish.",
