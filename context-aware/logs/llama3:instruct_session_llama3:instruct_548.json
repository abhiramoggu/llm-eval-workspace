With an impressive cast featuring Steve Buscemi and Mimi Rogers, this indie drama is sure to resonate with you.",

And who knows, you might just find yourself rooting for the feisty Katherine!\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, I'd recommend \"Heart of Darkness\" - it's a gripping adventure that takes you on a thrilling journey through the jungle to uncover the truth about Captain Kurtz. Plus, the 1910 film is a great piece of cinematic history.\n\nLet me know if either of these catch your eye!",
