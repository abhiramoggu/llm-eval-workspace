It's a classic supernatural thriller with a eerie atmosphere, featuring Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh - what a great combo! The plot follows an unearthly fog that rolls into a small coastal town, exactly 100 years after a ship mysteriously sank in its waters.\n\nOr if you're in the mood for something a bit more recent, I'd suggest \"The Jacket\" (2005). It's a thought-provoking and suspenseful film with a great cast, including Jennifer Jason Leigh and Brad Renfro. The story follows a rower who recounts an eerie encounter at the waterfront, exploring themes of time travel and the supernatural.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
