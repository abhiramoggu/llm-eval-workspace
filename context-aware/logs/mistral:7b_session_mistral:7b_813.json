This comedy features a senator's son who fancies himself as a rapper and gets kidnapped by two black actors pretending to be murderers. It's a fun and entertaining take on the political landscape.\n\nAnother movie that leans more towards political drama with a touch of satire is 'Definitely, Maybe'. This film follows a political consultant trying to explain his impending divorce and past relationships to his 11-year-old daughter. It's a heartwarming and thought-provoking story about love, life, and the complexities of adult relationships. Enjoy!",
