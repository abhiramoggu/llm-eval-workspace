The movie follows a genetically inferior man who assumes the identity of a superior one to pursue his dream of space travel. If you're looking for something else in the same vein, \"Maleficent\" is also worth checking out. It's a retelling of the classic Disney tale \"Sleeping Beauty,\" but with a darker and more mature twist, starring Angelina Jolie Pitt as the titular character.
