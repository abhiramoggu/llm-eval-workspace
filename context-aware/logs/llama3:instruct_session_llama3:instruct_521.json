It's a cult favorite from the 80s that has a delightfully cheesy premise about a tasty treat that becomes an addiction for some... and a nightmare for others. Danny Aiello stars alongside Garrett Morris and Paul Sorvino in this quirky gem.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for something quite so retro, I'd suggest \"Natural Born Killers\" instead. It's a gritty, intense thriller with a star-studded cast (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr.) that explores the darker side of media and society... and it just happens to have some seriously wild and gory zombie-like moments!",

Since you enjoyed something by Charles Robert Carner, I'm going to recommend two movies that share some similarities with his style.\n\nFirstly, 'Elysium' (2013) might be up your alley. This sci-fi thriller, directed by Neill Blomkamp, explores themes of class struggle and inequality, which could resonate with you if you enjoyed the depth in Carner's film. Plus, Matt Damon stars as a tough-as-nails protagonist who's on a mission to bring about change.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more grounded, 'The Revenant' (2015) might be an interesting choice. Directed by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, this survival drama follows a frontiersman (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) as he fights for survival in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear. It's a visually stunning film that explores themes of resilience and redemption.\n\nLet me know if either of these spark your interest!",
