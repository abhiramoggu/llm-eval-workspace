Tom Cruise stars as the titular character, a former Army Major turned investigator who must uncover the truth behind a mass shooting. The action-packed plot and Cruise's rugged performance make it a great choice.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different, \"Ender's Game\" (1985) might be up your alley. Based on the popular novel by Orson Scott Card, this sci-fi classic follows a young boy who becomes a leader in an intergalactic battle against alien invaders. The movie explores themes of war, leadership, and humanity.\n\nLet me know if either of these piques your interest!",

It's an action-packed thriller that explores the theme of identity and free will, with Ben Affleck playing a clever engineer on the run from mysterious forces. The movie has a great balance of suspense, humor, and intrigue, which might appeal to your taste after enjoying the offbeat tone of \"Her\".\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more sci-fi oriented, I'd suggest \"Planet Terror\", an adrenaline-fueled zombie romp that's part of the \"Grindhouse\" double feature. The film has a great retro vibe and features a diverse cast of characters fighting for survival against hordes of undead.",
