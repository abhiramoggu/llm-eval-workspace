It's a clever take on the classic rom-com, with Will Smith starring as a charming dating coach who helps men woo their perfect matches. With its witty dialogue and lovable characters, it's a great choice if you're in the mood for something light-hearted and fun.\n\nOr, if you're looking for something a bit more action-packed, \"Armageddon\" (1998) might be up your alley! This sci-fi disaster film stars Bruce Willis as the leader of a team of deep-drilling oil rig workers who must save the world from a massive asteroid threat. With its high-stakes plot and impressive special effects, it's an exciting ride that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.",
