This period drama is an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel and features a strong cast, including Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price. It's a great choice if you want to immerse yourself in the refined world of Regency England.\n\nIf you'd like something a bit more modern, I think \"Afterlife\" (2011) could be an interesting choice. This quirky drama stars Rupert Everett and Kate Winslet, and explores themes of family, love, and redemption through the lens of a ghostly encounter. It's a unique and captivating film that might surprise you!",

With its historical setting and Emma's story of self-discovery, I think you'll find it quite captivating.\n\nOut of the Dust, on the other hand, has a strong Western flair, with a dash of romance and adventure.
