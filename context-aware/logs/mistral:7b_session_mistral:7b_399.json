This film, set in the 60s, tells an engaging story about a criminal who pleads insanity and winds up in a mental institution, where he stands up to the tyrannical nurse. Starring Louise Fletcher as the formidable Nurse Ratched and Jack Nicholson as Randle Patrick McMurphy, it's a powerful film with unforgettable performances.\n\nAnother great option is \"The Shadows,\" which delves into the complex relationship between a psychiatrist and a patient, ultimately leading to a dangerous plot. The movie stars Matt Malloy and Kevin James, and offers a unique blend of suspense, drama, and psychological intrigue. Enjoy!",
