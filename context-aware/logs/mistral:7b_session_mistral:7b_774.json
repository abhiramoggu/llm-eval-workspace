This gritty drama revolves around a taxi driver who becomes a vigilante in New York City. Alternatively, there's also \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004), a unique film featuring an ensemble cast led by Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin, where existential detectives help individuals solve their deepest philosophical dilemmas.
