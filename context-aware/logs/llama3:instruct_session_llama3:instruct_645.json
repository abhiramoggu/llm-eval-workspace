This psychological thriller's premise, where a mysterious box grants wealth but at a deadly cost, is sure to captivate and unsettle you. The talented cast, including Frank Langella and Gillian Jacobs, adds an extra layer of intrigue.\n\nAlternatively, if you're in the mood for something more action-packed and thrilling, \"The Hunger Games\" (2008) might be the way to go! This iconic film brings the heart-pumping excitement of a deadly game to life, with memorable characters like Katniss Everdeen fighting for survival.",

Since you liked the sound of Psycho, I'm going to suggest Annie Hall and Treasure Planet.\n\nAnnie Hall is a classic film with a unique blend of humor and introspection, featuring Woody Allen in his iconic role as Alvy Singer. It's a great choice if you're looking for a thought-provoking movie that explores themes of relationships and identity.\n\nTreasure Planet, on the other hand, is a swashbuckling adventure that combines science fiction and classic pirate tales. With its stunning animation and memorable characters, it's an excellent option if you're in the mood for a thrilling ride.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
