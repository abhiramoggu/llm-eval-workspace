However, let me recommend two great Spaghetti Westerns that I believe you might enjoy:\n\n1. 'Innominandi (A Fistful of Dollars)' - A classic directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood as the mysterious Man with No Name. The plot revolves around a town torn apart by two feuding families, and the Man with No Name's clever manipulations to profit from their conflict.\n\n2. 'Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)' - Also directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is considered one of the greatest Western films ever made. Eastwood reprises his role as the Man with No Name, alongside Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The trio's intertwining storylines lead to a thrilling climax in search of buried treasure during the American Civil War.\n\nEnjoy exploring these timeless Spaghetti Western classics!",
