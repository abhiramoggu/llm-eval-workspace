The film stars Richard Armitage and Fay Masterson, but let's be honest, it's really all about the secrets hidden in those letters!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something more historical and romantic, I suggest \"In Our Time\" (1925). This classic film is a beautiful tale of love amidst war, with stunning visuals and a captivating storyline. You'll fall in love with the chemistry between the leads and be swept away by the drama.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
