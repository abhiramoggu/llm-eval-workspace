This superhero thriller has a unique plot twist, and while it's not in Hawaiian language, the movie's exploration of identity and self-discovery might resonate with your curiosity. Plus, Bruce Willis stars in this M. Night Shyamalan-directed film.\n\nFor another option, I suggest \"The Goodbye Girl\" (1977). Although this drama isn't in Hawaiian language either, its blend of mystery, suspense, and family dynamics might appeal to you. The movie features a talented cast, including Raymond J. Barry, Nicol Williamson, and Powers Boothe.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any questions!",
