This movie also explores the personal struggles of a historical figure, in this case, Adolf Hitler, as he faces his own downfall. The film features an impressive cast, including Bruno Ganz and Alexandra Maria Lara, who deliver powerful performances. Alternatively, if you're looking for a movie that also has a strong emotional component, \"Restless\" might be right up your alley. It follows a young man who is struggling to connect with others due to his inability to form meaningful relationships, until he meets someone who changes everything. Both of these movies offer thought-provoking and emotionally charged experiences that I think you'll find engaging!",
