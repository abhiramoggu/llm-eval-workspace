In their tensely dramatic story, Ayn Rand shows what the theories of Communism mean in practice. We the Living is not a story of politics but of the men and women who have to struggle for existence behind the Red banners and slogans. It is a picture of what dictatorship  - of any kind  - does to human beings, what kind of men are able to survive, and which of them remain as the ultimate winners. What happens to the defiant ones?
