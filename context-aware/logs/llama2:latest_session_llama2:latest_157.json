Here are two suggestions:\n\nIf you're in the mood for a high-octane thrill ride, I highly recommend \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" \u2013 it's an adrenaline-fueled ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, this movie is full of heart-pumping action sequences and a powerful female lead.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for something a bit more intense and darker in tone, \"The Raid: Redemption\" is an Indonesian martial arts film that will keep you guessing with its non-stop fight scenes and gritty atmosphere. Starring Iko Uwais as a rookie cop who must navigate a drug lord's high-rise building, this movie is sure to leave you breathless.",

Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a detective who must stop a group of terrorists from robbing a high-rise office building on Christmas Eve. The film features a mix of intense action sequences and witty banter between the characters, making for a thrilling and entertaining ride.",
