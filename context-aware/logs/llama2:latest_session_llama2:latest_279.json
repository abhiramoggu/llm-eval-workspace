Based on your preference for linguistics and the vibe you got from \"Restless,\" I recommend \"Why Did I Get Married?\" It's a heartwarming and thought-provoking film about the trials of marriage, featuring an talented ensemble cast including Tyler Perry, Janet Jackson, and Tasha Smith. The movie explores themes of love, forgiveness, and the complexities of relationships, which I think you'll find relatable and engaging. Alternatively, if you're in the mood for something a bit more action-packed, \"The Expendables 2\" might be up your alley. With a star-studded cast including Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, and Jet Li, this movie delivers non-stop action and adventure as a group of mercenaries take on a dangerous mission.",
