It's a classic comic fantasy that takes you on a whimsical adventure with Mickey as he explores the night kitchen and uncovers the secrets of how we get our morning cake. The animation is delightful, and it's sure to spark your imagination!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more intense, \"The Abyss\" (1989) might be up your alley. This sci-fi thriller follows Frigga as she fights to save her loved ones from the collapsing city that's threatening their lives. The special effects are still impressive today, and the suspense is palpable!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences!",
