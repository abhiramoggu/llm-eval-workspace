This campy romp stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline as two special agents trying to save President Grant from a diabolical Confederate scientist - it's a fun ride! \n\nIf you prefer something more recent and darkly fantastical, I'd recommend \"Maleficent\" (2014), starring Angelina Jolie Pitt as the titular vengeful fairy. This retelling of Sleeping Beauty offers a unique take on the classic tale with some impressive visuals.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or preferences!",
