I highly recommend \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), a classic movie that won several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film's powerful portrayal of the psychological effects of war on the soldiers who fought in Vietnam is deeply moving, with outstanding performances from Christopher Walken, Robert De Niro, and Meryl Streep.",

Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a character known for his gritty determination to uncover the truth about his past.\n\nIf you're in the mood for something a bit more cerebral, I'd recommend \"Zero Effect\". It's a clever and quirky mystery that follows the unlikely detective duo of Daryl Zero and Steve Arlo as they unravel a web of secrets and lies. With Ben Stiller bringing his signature humor to the role of Zero, this film is sure to delight fans of offbeat comedy and whodunits!",

This 90s classic explores the boundaries between life and death, delving into the psychological effects of near-death experiences. With a talented cast that includes Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland, it's a thought-provoking film that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll.\n\nAs for \"Witless Protection\" and \"We the Living\", they might not be as directly relevant to your interest in PTSD-themed movies.

This psychological thriller has a great premise: a woman's daily commute becomes a source of fascination when she witnesses a shocking event at a seemingly perfect couple's home. The film features Catherine Deneuve and \u00c9milie Dequenne in supporting roles, adding to its international flair.",
