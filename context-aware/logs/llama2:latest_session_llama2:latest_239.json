If you're in the mood for a stylish and sophisticated heist film, I would highly recommend \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" starring Ben Gazzara and Rene Russo. The plot follows a wealthy playboy who amuses himself by stealing artwork, but may have met his match in a seductive detective. The movie is known for its witty dialogue and visually stunning scenes.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a more lighthearted and comedic take on the heist genre, \"The Twits\" might be right up your alley. This 1980 film features a pair of wicked pranksters who plan an elaborate heist along with their crew of highly-trained animals. The movie is full of silly humor and fun performances from the talented cast.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations helpful and enjoyable!",
